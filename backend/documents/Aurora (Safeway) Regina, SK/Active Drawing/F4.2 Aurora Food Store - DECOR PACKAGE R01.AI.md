## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Electrical Coordination Gap**:
- **Issue**: Trellis lighting locations and quantities are not defined on this drawing
- **Impact**: Could delay installation or create rework if electrical not coordinated
- **Locations Affected**: Multiple areas (Produce, Meat, Dairy, Frozen)
- **Resolution Required**: Confirm electrical consultant has received ceiling plan and bulkhead locations
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Could cause schedule delays

**2. Bulkhead Height Transitions**:
- **Issue**: Multiple bulkhead height changes in close proximity
- **Potential Conflict**: Visual/aesthetic transitions between 7'-0", 8'-6", and 9'-6" heights
- **Locations**:
  - Meat Prep (7'-0") adjacent to Meat Sales (9'-6")
  - Seafood Prep (originally had bulkhead, now removed per Rev 1)
  - Cheese Prep (7'-0") adjacent to Deli Prep (8'-6")
- **Note**: Revision 1 specifically addresses some of these issues
- **Severity**: LOW - Design intent, but verify transitions work visually

**3. Cloud Ceiling and Trellis Coordination**:
- **Issue**: Cloud ceilings at 15'-4" A.F.F need to coordinate with trellis at same height
- **Potential Conflict**: Interference between cloud ceiling suspension and trellis supports
- **Locations**: Floral, Dairy, Frozen areas
- **Resolution Required**: Coordinate suspension points and structural support
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Could require structural coordination

**4. Equipment Clearances**:
- **Issue**: No equipment clearances shown on plan
- **Potential Conflict**: Refrigerated cases near bulkheads may interfere with ceiling work
- **Example**: VF6-12 AN cases near 9'-6" bulkheads in Seafood Sales
- **Severity**: LOW - Typical installation, but verify during coordination

**5. "Flip-Up" Bulkheads**:
- **Issue**: Two locations noted as "FLIP-UP" bulkheads (Meat Prep @ 7'-0", Scratch Bakery @ 8'-6")
- **Potential Conflict**: Unclear what "flip-up" means - access panel? Removable section?
- **Impact**: May affect construction detailing
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Requires clarification with architect/designer

**6. Site Verification Required**:
- **Note**: Legend includes "*PM TO SITE VERIFY"
- **Issue**: Some dimensions or conditions require field verification
- **Impact**: Final bulkhead locations may need adjustment
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Standard requirement but important for coordination

**7. Seafood Prep Bulkhead Removed**:
- **Revision Note**: "REMOVE BULKHEAD AT SEAFOOD PREP"
- **Potential Issue**: Verify if this creates exposed ceiling condition
- **Impact**: May require ceiling finish coordination
- **Severity**: LOW - Addressed in revision

**8. Receiving Area Clearances**:
- **Issue**: 1.5 metre clearance noted but relationship to overhead elements unclear
- **Impact**: Need to verify clearance includes bulkheads and suspended elements
- **Severity**: LOW - Standard requirement

### Inconsistencies Identified

**1. Drawing Scale Statement**:
- **Issue**: "THIS DRAWING IS NOT TO BE SCALED" in disclaimer
- **Conflict**: Drawing shows scale of "1/8" = 1'-0""
- **Interpretation**: Use dimensions, not scaled measurements
- **Severity**: INFORMATIONAL

**2. Revision Tracking**:
- **Issue**: Revision R1 date shows 2024.12.03 but first draft shows same date (appears to be error)
- **First Draft**: 2024.07.22
- **Revision 1**: 2024.12.03
- **Severity**: LOW - Administrative, but verify correct revision date

**3. Multiple "NOTES:" Labels**:
- **Issue**: Three instances of "NOTES:" appear on drawing with no associated notes visible
- **Locations**: Near Meat Sales, HMR area, Floral area
- **Impact**: May indicate missing information or notes to be added
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Verify if notes are missing

**4. Equipment Code Consistency**:
- **Issue**: Some equipment uses different code formats (e.g., "PV03-8-6" vs "PV3-1-8")
- **Impact**: May indicate different manufacturers or product lines
- **Severity**: LOW - Verify with equipment schedules
