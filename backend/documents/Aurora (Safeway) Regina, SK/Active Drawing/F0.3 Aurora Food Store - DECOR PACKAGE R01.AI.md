## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Washroom Signage Removal**:
   - Revision 1 indicates "REMOVE WASHROOM SIGNAGE NOTES"
   - However, detailed washroom signage specifications still appear in images 1-2
   - **CONFLICT**: Unclear if washroom signs are being installed or if only notes were removed
   - **Recommendation**: Clarify with architect if washroom signage is part of scope

2. **Standard Signs Not Being Used**:
   - Revision 1 states "UPDATE TO SHOW WHICH STANDARD SIGNS ARE NOT BEING USED"
   - Drawing does not clearly mark or indicate which standard signs are excluded
   - **CONFLICT**: Missing visual indicators (strike-through, "NOT USED" notation, etc.)
   - **Recommendation**: Request clarification on excluded signage items

3. **Dimensional Inconsistencies**:
   - Some dimensions appear with mixed units (IN vs feet vs breed)
   - "Breed" appears to be a non-standard unit designation
   - **CONFLICT**: Unit conversion uncertainty
   - **Recommendation**: Verify all dimensions with design team

4. **Mounting Details**:
   - Limited mounting specifications shown for wall-mounted signs
   - Oval Corbet signage (32) shows "veea cohbebonding bvinier logo" but mounting unclear
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Request structural mounting details for larger signs

5. **Pantone Color Application**:
   - Multiple Pantone colors referenced but not all applications are clearly marked
   - Some signs show color blocks without clear specification
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Create color application matrix for contractor clarity

6. **Text Legibility Issues**:
   - Many text elements in extracted markdown appear corrupted/OCR errors
   - Makes specification interpretation difficult
   - **CRITICAL**: Original PDF should be primary reference document

### Coordination Requirements

1. **Electrical Coordination**:
   - Frosted lift crystal signage (SO) appears to be illuminated
   - Requires coordination with electrical drawings for power connections
   - **ACTION**: Verify electrical rough-in locations with E-series drawings

2. **Structural Coordination**:
   - Oval Corbet signage (83" width) requires structural support verification
   - Hanging seasonal signs require ceiling structure review
   - **ACTION**: Coordinate with structural engineer for mounting capacity

3. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Washroom signage shows tactile/braille elements
   - Must verify mounting heights comply with local accessibility codes
   - **ACTION**: Confirm all sign mounting heights with accessibility consultant

4. **Brand Standards**:
   - Safeway logo usage must comply with corporate brand guidelines
   - **ACTION**: Verify all Safeway branding with corporate standards
