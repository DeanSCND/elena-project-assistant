## 3. CROSS-REFERENCES

### Referenced Drawings
**Electrical Coordination:**
- "REFER TO ELECTRICAL DRAWINGS FOR DETAILS" - noted multiple times
- "ALL TRELLIS LIGHTING LOCATIONS AND AMOUNT TO BE PROVIDED BY ELECTRICAL CONSULTANT"
- This indicates electrical drawings are critical companions to this RCP

**Other Drawing References:**
- Consultant's drawings mentioned in general notes
- Survey, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical consultant information referenced
- Drawing must be coordinated with "appropriate consultant's drawings"

### Equipment Supplier Tags
Multiple equipment items have vendor codes suggesting cross-reference to:
- AN (appears to be primary vendor code)
- HP (vendor code)
- HM (vendor code)
- CD (vendor code)
- QBD (vendor code)
- DP (vendor code)
- AQ (vendor code)
- HT (vendor code)
- LCR (vendor code)

### Trellis System Cross-References
- SAF-TRE-013 series (A01, A02, A03, A04, B01-02, B02-02, B03-02, B04-02, C01, C02, C03)
- These likely reference detailed trellis fabrication/installation drawings

### Cloud Ceiling Cross-References
- "CEILING CLOUD DETAILS" referenced at scale 1/4" = 1'-0"
- Four cloud ceilings numbered 1-4 with detail callouts

---

## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Clearance Concerns:**
- Multiple equipment clearance radii overlap in tight spaces
- 6'-0" minimum clearances may conflict with equipment placement in prep areas
- Trellis at 15'-4" AFF vs. structure at 26'-0" AFF = only 10'-8" working space
- Cloud ceilings mounted at 15'-4" AFF may interfere with maintenance access to structure

**2. Ceiling Height Variations:**
- Transition zones between different ceiling heights (9'-0" to 10'-0" to 10'-6") not detailed
- ACT1 @ 9'-0" adjacent to ACT2 @ 10'-0" - bulkhead/soffit details not shown on RCP
- Cloud ceilings protruding into space may conflict with sprinkler coverage

**3. Equipment vs. Ceiling Coordination:**
- Equipment with significant height (80QT Mixer, Spiral Mixer, Sheeter, Rounder) in areas with ACT2 @ 10'-6" - clearance verification needed
- Flip-up equipment locations not dimensioned - potential ceiling interference
- Dunnage shelving at 5' AFF may conflict with ceiling access panels

**4. HVAC/Mechanical Coordination:**
- No visible HVAC equipment or ductwork shown on RCP (expected for coordination)
- Cooler panel ceilings typically require mechanical equipment above - not indicated
- Compressor room location on Service Mezzanine but no indication of how refrigeration lines route through ceilings

**5. Lighting Coordination:**
- "Refer to electrical drawings" notes suggest lighting not fully coordinated on this drawing
- Trellis lighting "TO BE PROVIDED BY ELECTRICAL CONSULTANT" - may conflict with structural trellis layout
- Multiple "LIGHTS" callouts with 144" dimensions but no fixture types or quantities

**6. Access and Maintenance:**
- No ceiling access panels indicated for maintenance of above-ceiling equipment
- Cooler ceilings @ 10'-0" with no visible access hatches for compressor/refrigeration maintenance
- Tight clearances in prep areas may impede ceiling tile removal

**7. Structural Coordination:**
- Structure painted PT7 but no indication of beam/joist locations relative to ceiling elements
- Trellis suspension points not coordinated with structural grid
- Cloud ceiling suspension systems not detailed

**8. Dimensional Conflicts:**
- Some radius dimensions (R 178.465") appear excessive for space available
- 172'-0" overall width vs. sum of internal dimensions should be verified
- Mezzanine stair clearances (1M vs. 6'-0" min) - inconsistent units and clearances

### Items Requiring Verification

1. **Electrical load locations** - coordinate with electrical RCP
2. **Sprinkler head locations** - coordinate with fire protection drawings
3. **HVAC diffuser/return locations** - coordinate with mechanical drawings
4. **Structural beam depths** - verify clearances at trellis suspension points
5. **Door swing clearances** - ensure ceiling transitions don't create head clearance issues
6. **Accessibility clearances** - verify 6'-0" minimums meet code
7. **Emergency egress lighting** - coordinate with electrical
8. **Smoke detector locations** - coordinate with fire alarm drawings

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Accessibility (Assumed Canadian Building Code / Provincial Codes)

**Clearances:**
- Multiple 6'-0" minimum clearances noted - verify this meets accessibility requirements for maneuvering space
- 1.5 metre clearance at receiving (approximately 4'-11") - verify adequate for accessible route
- Stair design (19 risers) - verify riser/tread dimensions meet code (not provided on RCP)

**Ceiling Heights:**
- 9'-0" AFF minimum in sales areas appears adequate
- Verify protruding elements (cloud ceilings, trellis) maintain minimum 6'-8" clear height at accessible routes
- Vestibule ceiling height adequate for accessible entry

### Life Safety

**Egress:**
- Exit paths not clearly marked on RCP but spatial layout suggests multiple egress routes
- Verify ceiling heights at egress paths meet minimum requirements
- Stair enclosure ceiling not specified - typically requires fire-rated assembly

**Fire Protection:**
- Cooler panel ceilings @ 10'-0" - verify sprinkler coverage and code requirements for refrigerated spaces
- Cloud ceilings may obstruct sprinkler spray patterns - coordinate with fire protection engineer
- Trellis structures may require additional sprinkler heads or special design
- No indication of fire-rated ceiling assemblies where required (typically at property lines, between occupancies)

**Smoke Control:**
- Structure exposed to 26'-0" in sales area - verify smoke control/management strategy
- Large open sales floor may require smoke control systems - not indicated on RCP

### Energy Code

**Cooler/Freezer Ceilings:**
- Panel ceilings indicated for all coolers/freezers - verify insulation values meet energy code
- Transitions from conditioned space to coolers - verify thermal breaks

**Lighting:**
- Trellis lighting and other fixtures must meet energy code for retail applications
- Coordinate with electrical for lighting power density compliance

### Building Code - General

**Ceiling Assembly Types:**
- ACT1 and ACT2 systems - verify acoustic performance if required
- Drywall ceilings painted PT6/PT7 - verify paint meets flame spread requirements
- Cooler panel ceilings - verify material meets code for food preparation areas

**Height and Area:**
- Overall building area appears to be approximately 52,000 SF (303' x 172')
- Verify occupancy classification (likely Group A2 - Retail) and allowable height/area
- Mezzanine areas factor into total building area - verify compliance

**Food Safety (Health Code):**
- Multiple food prep areas with ACT2 ceilings - verify ceiling materials meet health code for food preparation
- Cooler ceilings must be cleanable and moisture-resistant
- Seafood Prep, Meat Prep, Bakery Prep, Deli Prep - all require smooth, cleanable ceilings

**Mechanical/Refrigeration:**
- Compressor room location on Service Mezzanine - verify ventilation requirements
- Cooler panel ceilings typically require specific insulation and vapor barrier - not detailed

### Specific Code Notes on Drawing

**Drawing Disclaimer:**
"CONSTRUCTION MUST CONFORM TO ALL APPLICABLE CODES AND REQUIREMENTS OF AUTHORITIES HAVING JURISDICTION"
- This places responsibility on contractor to verify code compliance
- Implies this drawing is for design intent and must be verified against local codes

**"NOT TO BE SCALED" Warning:**
- Critical for code compliance verification - dimensions must be confirmed, not scaled

**Contractor Responsibility:**
"THE CONTRACTOR MUST VERIFY AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL DIMENSIONS AND CONDITIONS ON SITE"
- Contractor must field-verify before construction
- Any discrepancies must be reported to architect/designer

### Potential Code Deficiencies Requiring Clarification

1. **Fire rating of ceiling assemblies** - not specified where required
2. **Accessibility clearances** - some dimensions appear tight (6'-0" min may be insufficient)
3. **Egress path ceiling heights** - verify cloud ceilings don't obstruct
4. **Sprinkler obstruction** - cloud ceilings and trellis may require analysis
5. **Food prep area finishes** - verify ceiling materials meet health code
6. **Stair enclosure** - no indication of fire-rated construction
7. **Ventilation** - no indication of mechanical ventilation for back-of-house areas
8. **Emergency lighting** - not shown (coordinate with electrical)
9. **Refrigeration equipment screening** - not indicated if required by code
