1. **Ceiling Height Variations**
   - Drawing shows "U/S OF CEILING" without specific dimension in some details
   - Steel deck shown at 26'-0" in some sections, but "U/S OF DECK" without dimension in others
   - **Action Required**: Verify ceiling heights across different store areas with architectural plans

2. **Material Finish References**
   - Multiple references to "PL1 OR PL7" indicating alternative finishes
   - Actual finish selection must be verified with F3.1 and F7.1
   - **Action Required**: Confirm which laminate (PL1 or PL7) applies to each department area

3. **Supplier Coordination**
   - Datum elements (2.25"H x 3"W) by Sobeys supplier
   - Decor material stretched over metal frame by Sobeys supplier
   - **Potential Conflict**: Interface between GC work (bulkheads, blocking) and supplier-provided elements
   - **Action Required**: Establish clear demarcation of scope between GC and Sobeys supplier

4. **Lighting Coordination**
   - Track lighting hung by aircraft cable to U/S of joist @ 15'-0" AFF

   - **Action Required**: Verify department boundaries on floor plan to ensure correct detail application

6. **Tile Extending Above Ceiling**
   - Both washroom tile (F1.2/4) and WT1 tile (F1.2/5) note "full tile to extend above ceiling"
   - **Potential Issue**: Coordination with ceiling grid installation
   - **Action Required**: Sequence tile installation before ceiling, verify waterproofing requirements

7. **Secondary Bulkhead**
   - F1.2/2 shows double bulkhead configuration
   - F1.2/6 notes secondary bulkhead behind decor bulkhead
   - **Potential Issue**: Structural support and coordination for dual bulkhead system
   - **Action Required**: Verify structural requirements with architect and engineer

### Inconsistencies or Ambiguities

1. **Graphic Representation Note**
   - Note states "GRAPHIC IMAGE AND LETTER ARE FOR REPRESENTATION PURPOSES ONLY"
   - **Ambiguity**: Actual graphics must be obtained from F3.1 and F7.1
   - **Impact**: The watercolor pattern images may not represent final appearance

2. **Bracing Requirements**
