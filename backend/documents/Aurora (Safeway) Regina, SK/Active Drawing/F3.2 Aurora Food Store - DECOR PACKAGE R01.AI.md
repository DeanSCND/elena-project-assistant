## IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Water-Resistant Adhesive Extent Ambiguity**
   - Multiple areas show "extent of water resistant adhesive" with hatching
   - Precise boundaries may require field verification
   - Coordination needed with plumbing fixtures and floor drains
   - 4'-0" clearance requirement from wet walls needs precise measurement in field

2. **VCT Grain Direction Coordination**
   - "Direction of VCT grain" indicated but relies on separate enlarged detail
   - Pattern alignment at room transitions not fully detailed
   - Quarter-turn at center of store requires careful layout and field verification
   - Risk of pattern mismatch if not properly coordinated

3. **FF12 Strip Alignment**
   - Note 4 requires FF12 framing tile grids to align with FF11 grids
   - This coordination is critical but challenging with different module sizes (4"x36" vs 12"x12")
   - May require field adjustments or custom cutting
   - 1/3 step pattern on 45° angle adds complexity

4. **Corner Mitering Details**
   - Minimum 8" length requirement at corners may conflict with field conditions
   - Tight corners or irregular geometry not fully detailed
   - Mitered joints require skilled installation; quality control critical

5. **Transition Strip Locations**
   - 2" epoxy strips required at "all flooring transitions (typ.)"
   - Not all transition locations clearly marked on plan
   - May require field determination where floor finishes meet
   - Coordination with base/wall finishes not shown

6. **Missing Floor Finish Definitions**
   - FF5, FF6, FF8, and FF15 are designated but not clearly defined in images
   - Specifications for these finishes may be on separate schedules or details
   - Risk of incorrect material selection without complete information
