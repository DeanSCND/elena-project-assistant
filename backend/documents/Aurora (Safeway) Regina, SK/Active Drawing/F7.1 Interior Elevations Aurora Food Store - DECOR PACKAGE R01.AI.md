---

## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Responsibility Matrix Ambiguity**:
   - **Floral Panels**: Drawing states "PROVIDED BY TC AND INSTALLED BY GC" - requires clarification of TC (Tenant Coordinator? Tenant Contractor?)
   - **TV Menu Boards**: Multiple locations shown but installation responsibility not clearly stated on all elevations
   - **Digital Billboards**: No installation notes - coordinate with electrical/AV contractor

2. **Dimension Inconsistencies**:
   - Question mark ("?") appears on Elevation 12 at specific location - requires field verification or design clarification
   - "VINYL WALL COVERING TBD" noted on Elevation 6 - material selection incomplete

3. **Spelling Error**:
   - **Elevation 7 Title**: "MEAT / SEAFFOOD" should be "MEAT / SEAFOOD" - potential for construction confusion

4. **Finish Transitions**:
   - Multiple angled bulkheads with varying heights may create complex finish transitions
   - Grain direction changes noted in revision (PL11 at Bakery and Meat & Seafood) - verify field coordination
   - Wall dado removal at Seafood Prep (per revision notes) - verify wall substrate condition

5. **Glazing Coordination**:
   - **Elevation 14 (Meat Prep)**: Glazing shown but no frame details, glass type, or safety glazing specifications noted
   - Height of glazing (11'-4") may require tempered or laminated glass per code
   - No sill or head details shown

6. **Bulkhead Heights**:
   - New bulkhead heights updated at Meat Sales and HMR per revision - verify ceiling/MEP coordination
   - Secondary bulkheads at varying heights may conflict with HVAC distribution
   - "U/S SECONDARY BULKHEAD" varies by location - requires coordination with ceiling grid

7. **Concrete Curb Finish**:
   - Note specifies "ALL CUSTOMER FACING CONCRETE CURBS TO BE FINISHED WITH ELASTOMERIC PAINT (PT7)"
   - No curb locations specifically dimensioned on elevations - coordinate with floor plans
   - Elastomeric paint application on horizontal surfaces may have durability concerns

8. **Equipment Case Coordination**:
   - "TOP OF CASE" noted on multiple elevations
   - Case heights not provided - requires equipment shop drawings before final finish installation
   - Tile/finish termination at cases must accommodate future equipment changes

### Missing Information

1. **Material Samples**: No reference to approved material samples or mock-ups
2. **Signage Details**: Letter sizes, mounting methods, illumination requirements not shown
3. **Joint Locations**: No control joint or expansion joint locations indicated
4. **Substrate Requirements**: No wall construction or backing requirements specified
5. **Accessibility**: No verification of finish transitions meeting accessibility codes
6. **Fire Rating**: No indication if any walls require fire-rated finishes

### Coordination Requirements

1. **MEP Coordination**:
   - Verify all TV menu boards and digital billboards have power/data rough-ins
   - Confirm bulkhead soffits do not conflict with ductwork, sprinkler heads, or lighting
   - Coordinate tile terminations with floor drains in prep areas

2. **Structural Coordination**:
   - Verify bulkhead framing support for applied finishes (PL11 panels are heavy)
   - Confirm structure can support signage letter mounting
   - Validate glazing frame attachment points at Meat Prep

3. **Equipment Coordination**:
   - Obtain display case shop drawings before finalizing tile/finish heights
   - Confirm slatwall attachment backing exists at Customer Service location
   - Verify bulk shelving locations match finish layout

4. **Code Compliance Coordination**:
   - Confirm all prep area finishes meet health department requirements
   - Verify glazing at Meat Prep meets safety glazing requirements
   - Validate finish materials in food areas are NSF approved or equivalent

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Food Safety & Health Code Requirements

1. **Tile Wainscot in Food Preparation Areas**:
   - WT1 (white tile) extensively used in Meat Prep, Seafood Prep, Bakery, Deli
   - Typical height: 7'-0" minimum
   - **Code Requirement**: Food preparation areas typically require smooth, non-porous, easily cleanable surfaces
   - **Compliance**: Ceramic tile (WT1) meets food-safe requirements if properly installed with epoxy grout
   - **Verify**: Local health department may require specific height above equipment

2. **Concrete Curb Finishes**:
   - **Specified**: Elastomeric paint (PT7) on all customer-facing curbs
   - **Concern**: Elastomeric paint on horizontal surfaces subject to cart traffic may not be durable
   - **Recommendation**: Verify with health department if paint meets requirements for food service areas

3. **Wall Finishes in Prep Areas**:
   - **Seafood Prep**: Revision removed wall dado, updated to WT1 (full tile)
   - **Compliance**: Improvement - full tile is more sanitary than partial dado
   - **Meat Prep**: Glazing provides visibility while maintaining separation
   - **Verify**: All finishes in prep areas should be NSF listed or meet local health code

### Building Code Considerations

4. **Glazing Safety**:
   - **Location**: Meat Prep glazing (Elevation 14)
   - **Height**: Extends 11'-4" high, 6" above floor to 11'-10"
   - **Code Requirement**: IBC 2406 - Safety glazing required in hazardous locations
   - **Compliance Concern**: Glazing adjacent to food prep may be considered hazardous location
   - **Recommendation**: Specify tempered or laminated safety glazing, verify with building official

5. **Flame Spread & Smoke Development**:
   - Multiple combustible finishes specified (PL series laminates, vinyl wall coverings)
   - **Code Requirement**: IBC Chapter 8 - Interior finishes must meet Class A, B, or C ratings depending on occupancy
   - **Occupancy**: Mercantile (M) with Food Service areas
   - **Requirement**: Typically Class A or B finishes in exit access corridors

   - **Vinyl Wall Covering**: Must be tested per ASTM E84 and meet applicable class

6. **Accessibility (ADA/AODA Compliance)**:
   - **Protruding Objects**: Signage letters and wall-mounted elements must comply
   - **Code**: ADA 307 - Objects projecting >4" from wall between 27"-80" AFF are prohibited
   - **Verify**: All department signage, menu boards, and decorative elements meet projection limits
   - **Floor Transitions**: Finish transitions at different flooring types must be flush or beveled

7. **Means of Egress**:
   - **Concern**: Bulkheads and decor elements must not reduce required egress width
   - **Code**: IBC 1005 - Minimum corridor width requirements
   - **Verify**: Protruding finishes, display cases, and equipment do not encroach into required egress

### Electrical & Life Safety

8. **Emergency Egress Illumination**:
   - Digital billboards and TV menu boards may impact emergency lighting calculations
   - **Verify**: Emergency lighting still meets minimum 1 footcandle at floor level
   - **Coordinate**: With electrical drawings for emergency lighting placement

9. **Fire Alarm Device Visibility**:
   - Bulkheads and signage may obstruct visual fire alarm notification devices
   - **Code**: NFPA 72 - Visual notification appliances require clear line of sight
   - **Coordinate**: With fire alarm contractor for strobe placement

### Sanitation & Maintenance

10. **Cleanability**:
    - **Requirement**: All food service area finishes must be smooth, non-absorbent, easily cleanable
    - **Vinyl Wall Covering**: Acceptable if seamless or with sealed seams
    - **Wood Grain Laminates (PL series)**: Acceptable if plastic laminate (not wood veneer)
    - **Verify**: All specified materials are non-porous and cleanable per health code

11. **Durability in High-Traffic Areas**:
    - **Vestibule**: Subject to weather, high traffic, cart impact
    - **Specified**: Mix of PT6, PL3, vinyl wall covering
    - **Concern**: Vinyl wall covering durability in vestibule exposed to weather
    - **Recommendation**: Verify vinyl wall covering is Type II (medium/heavy duty) minimum

### Energy Code Considerations

    - Multiple TV menu boards and digital billboards specified
    - **Code**: Energy code may limit display wattage or require automatic shutoff
    - **Verify**: Compliance with ASHRAE 90.1 or local energy code for display power

### Local Authority Requirements

13. **Health Department Approval**:
    - **Required**: All food preparation and service area finishes typically require health department plan review
    - **Areas**: Meat Prep, Seafood Prep, Bakery, Deli, Cheese, HMR
    - **Action**: Submit finish schedule and elevations to local health authority for approval before construction

14. **Building Permit**:
    - Interior finish changes may require building permit
