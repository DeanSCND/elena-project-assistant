  - Mechanical systems
  - Electrical systems
- Construction must conform to all applicable codes
- Coordinate with authorities having jurisdiction

---

## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Issues

1. **Electrical Coordination Critical**
   - "Electrical and termination points for all illuminated signage" noted
   - TV and billboard mounts require power
   - NO specific electrical details on this sheet
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Coordinate with electrical drawings for exact power locations
   - **CONFLICT RISK**: High - illuminated signage installation depends on electrical roughin timing

2. **Trellis Installation Sequence**
   - Largest trellis element: 106'-7.25" wide × 4'-10" high
   - Multiple overhead trellis systems spanning departments
   - **COORDINATION NEEDED**:
     - Ceiling grid installation must precede trellis
     - HVAC ductwork and lighting conflicts must be resolved
     - Refer to F4.1 & F4.2 for mounting details
   - **CONFLICT RISK**: Medium - no ceiling heights specified on this sheet

3. **Responsibility Matrix Clarity**
   - Signage Legend does NOT specify Sobeys vs. GC responsibility clearly
   - Millwork chart is explicit (all Sobeys)
   - **AMBIGUITY**: Who installs the signage and trellis elements?
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: RFI to clarify installation responsibility for all signage items

4. **Double-Sided Signage Details**
   - Multiple items noted as "double-sided" (checkout toppers, aisle signs)
   - No section cuts or mounting details shown
   - **COORDINATION NEEDED**: Verify visibility sightlines and mounting hardware
   - **CONFLICT RISK**: Low - but verify with referenced detail sheets

5. **BC Only Notation**
   - "BC ONLY" note appears in Millwork chart
   - Unclear what this refers to (British Columbia? Building Code?)
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Clarify meaning with design team

6. **Scale Notation**
   - Scale listed as "1/4" = 1'-0""
   - However, this is a matrix chart with no plan view
   - **ISSUE**: Scale notation may be error/carryover from template
   - Dimensions are provided numerically, so not critical

7. **Datum Line Reference**
   - "72" LENGTH" and "DATUM LINE" noted
   - No elevation or datum height specified
   - **COORDINATION NEEDED**: Establish datum elevation for signage mounting heights
   - **CONFLICT RISK**: Medium - consistent signage heights critical for visual continuity

8. **Sheet Reference Inconsistency**
   - Ceiling Clouds: "Refer to F0.2" (this sheet)
   - Implies detail should be on this sheet but none visible
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify if ceiling cloud details exist or if reference is error

### Missing Information

1. **Mounting Heights**: No finished floor elevations or AFF dimensions for signage
2. **Material Specifications**: Colors and textures shown but no material call-outs or finish schedules
3. **Illumination Details**: No lumen output, color temperature, or electrical specs
4. **Substrate Requirements**: No wall backing or blocking specifications
5. **Installation Sequence**: No phasing or installation priority noted

---

## 6. CONSTRUCTION NOTES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Pre-Construction

1. **RFI List Required**
   - Clarify Sobeys vs. GC responsibility for signage installation
   - Confirm "BC ONLY" notation meaning
   - Request ceiling cloud details referenced to F0.2
   - Verify all cross-referenced drawings available

2. **Submittal Requirements**
   - Shop drawings for all trellis systems (especially large-span elements)
   - Material samples for all finishes shown in color/texture images
   - Illuminated signage: electrical specs, photometric data
   - Structural calculations for ceiling clouds and trellis

3. **Coordination Meetings**
   - MEP coordination critical for trellis/ceiling cloud areas
   - Electrical rough-in must precede signage installation
   - Review installation sequence with Sobeys fixture team

### Installation Sequencing

**Recommended Order:**
1. Ceiling grid and cloud installation
2. Electrical rough-in for illuminated signage
3. Trellis system installation
4. Large-format graphics and department headers
5. Millwork and stainless steel elements (Sobeys)
6. Final signage and toppers
7. Touchup and punchlist

### Quality Control Checkpoints

- Verify all dimensions on site before fabrication
- Mock-up required for ceiling cloud system
- Test illuminated signage for uniform brightness
- Confirm all double-sided elements visible from intended sightlines
- Validate ADA-compliant mounting heights

## 10. OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS FOR DESIGN TEAM

1. Who is responsible for installation of signage and trellis elements listed in "Signage and Trellis Legend"?
2. What does "BC ONLY" notation mean in the Millwork matrix?
3. Where are the ceiling cloud details referenced to "Refer to F0.2"?
4. What are the mounting heights (AFF) for all signage elements?
5. Are material specifications and finish schedules provided on another sheet?
6. What is the structural support system for the 106-foot trellis span?
7. Are photometric calculations available for illuminated signage?
8. What is the phasing/sequence for Sobeys fixture installation vs. GC work?

---

## CONCLUSION

This decor package drawing establishes the decorative identity and responsibility matrix for the Aurora Food Store. The comprehensive signage program includes 100+ individual elements ranging from massive trellis structures to small wayfinding signs. Critical coordination with electrical, structural, and Sobeys fixture installation teams is essential. The clear delineation of millwork/stainless steel responsibilities (all Sobeys) contrasts with ambiguous signage installation responsibilities requiring clarification before construction.

**PRIORITY ACTIONS:**
1. Issue RFI for signage installation responsibility
2. Obtain all cross-referenced detail sheets
3. Coordinate electrical rough-in locations
4. Schedule pre-construction meeting with Sobeys fixture team
