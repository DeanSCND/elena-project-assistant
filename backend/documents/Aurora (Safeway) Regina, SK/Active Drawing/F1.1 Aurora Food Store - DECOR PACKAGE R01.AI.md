## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

#### 1. **Bulkhead Height Variations**
- **Issue**: Multiple bulkhead heights in close proximity (7'-0", 8'-6", 9'-6" A.F.F.)
- **Locations**:
  - Meat Sales transitions from 7'-0" to 9'-6"
  - HMR area transitions from 7'-0" to 8'-6"
  - Seating area shows 7'-0" adjacent to 9'-6" areas
- **Coordination Need**: Verify ceiling transitions, HVAC ductwork clearances, lighting integration at transitions
- **Risk**: Mechanical/electrical conflicts at height transitions

#### 2. **Revision-Related Changes**
Revision R1 (2024.12.03) made significant modifications:
- "UPDATE NEW BULKHEAD HEIGHT AT MEAT SALES AND HMR"
- "SHOW NEW BULKHEADS AT DAIRY AND SEAFOOD COOLER"
- "REMOVE BULKHEAD AT SEAFOOD PREP"
- "UPDATE TO SOLID WALLS AT SEATING AREA"
- "RAISE UNDERSIDE OF VESTIBULE CURTAIN WALLS"

**Concerns**:
- Have mechanical, electrical, and plumbing consultants updated their drawings for these changes?
- Solid walls at seating area may impact HVAC distribution, acoustics, and sightlines
- Raised vestibule curtain walls affect heating/cooling at entry

#### 3. **Mezzanine Coordination**
- **Staff Mezzanine**: 19-riser stairs (UP/DN noted)
- **Service Mezzanine**: Compressor Room access
- **Coordination Issues**:
  - Structure supporting mezzanines not shown (requires structural drawings)
  - Guardrail/railing details not indicated
  - Acoustic isolation for compressor room above sales floor
  - Vibration isolation requirements not noted

#### 4. **Equipment Density - Pharmacy Area**
- **High concentration**: 7× "96-62-48 LH LCR" casework units, 3× "WC2557 QBD" units
- **Limited space** with "COMP. EQ.", U/C Fridge, SS Countertop, Eyewash
- **Risk**: Insufficient circulation, mechanical/electrical rough-in conflicts
- **Verify**: ADA/accessibility clearances in work areas

#### 5. **Receiving Area**
- **20 pallets storage** with "1.5 METRE CLEARANCE"
- **Equipment**: SN-04L 3C-24×20 (unclear function)
- **Concerns**:
  - Loading dock location not shown on this plan

  - 1.5M clearance may be insufficient for safe operations with 20 pallets

#### 6. **Cooler/Freezer Door Swing Conflicts**
- Multiple coolers/freezers in tight proximity (Meat, Seafood, Produce, Dairy, Bakery, Kitchen, Floral, Deli)
- **No door swing arcs shown** on plan
- **Risk**: Door swings may conflict with equipment, circulation, or adjacent doors
- **Critical locations**:
  - Seafood Cooler adjacent to Produce Cooler
  - Meat Cooler/Freezer/Kitchen area (tight cluster)
  - Dairy Cooler near Bakery Cooler

#### 7. **"FLIP-UP" Counter Details**
- Noted at Meat Prep and Bakery Prep
- **No detail reference** provided for construction
- **Coordination**: Hardware, ADA compliance, electrical if powered, structural support

#### 8. **Equipment Code Ambiguity**
- Multiple manufacturer codes (AN, HP, HM, CD, HT, DP, QBD, LCR, AQ)
- **No legend provided** explaining manufacturer abbreviations
- **Risk**: Procurement errors, specification mismatches
- **Action needed**: Cross-reference with equipment schedules

### Missing Information

2. Request door swing diagrams for all cooler/freezer doors
3. Clarify equipment manufacturer codes and cross-reference with specs
4. Verify ADA clearances in Pharmacy prep area
5. Request structural coordination for mezzanine support
6. Confirm vestibule curtain wall height change does not conflict with storefront system
7. Clarify "FLIP-UP" counter construction details
8. Verify receiving area layout accommodates safe pallet handling
