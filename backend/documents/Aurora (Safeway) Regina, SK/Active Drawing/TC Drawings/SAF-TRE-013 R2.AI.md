- **Issue:** 6-day discrepancy in approval dates suggests staggered approval process or potential date error

### 4.2 Dimensional Concerns

**Tolerance Stack-Up:**
- Multiple 96" (2,438mm) sections connected in series
- With ±1/16" tolerance per section, a 3-section assembly could accumulate ±3/16" error
- **Recommendation:** Consider specifying tighter tolerances for extrusion lengths or overall assembly length tolerance

**Flat Pattern vs. Formed Dimensions:**
- Folded beam assemblies show both flat pattern and formed dimensions
- Bend allowances appear built into flat patterns
- **Verify:** Confirm bend radius and K-factor assumptions for material thickness

**Metric Conversions:**
- Most conversions appear accurate (e.g., 314" = 7,976mm)
- Some fractional dimensions show rounding (e.g., 127-29/32" = 3,249mm vs. calculated 3,248.8mm)
- **Minor Issue:** Metric conversions rounded to nearest mm, acceptable for fabrication

### 4.3 Material Specification Gaps

**Incomplete Material Callouts:**
- VU2-CS23 connector brackets: No material specification provided

- Multiple bends per part (typical 4 bends to create channel profile)
- No bend sequence specified
- **Risk:** Inconsistent bending could affect fit-up with sintra supports

**Hole Drilling:**
- Note on extrusions: "ONLY THE RIGHT ENDS GET A HOLE"
- Requires careful orientation tracking during fabrication
- Left/right orientation must be maintained through assembly
- **Recommendation:** Add orientation marks or labels

**Spline Cutting:**
- Extensive cut lists with precise lengths (e.g., 60.375", 74.125")
- 1-1/2" x 1-1/32" profile PVCWHI1 material
- Fractional inch precision required
- **Concern:** Cumulative cutting errors could affect overall fit
