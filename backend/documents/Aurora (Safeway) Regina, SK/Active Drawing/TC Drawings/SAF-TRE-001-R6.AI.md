## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & CONCERNS

### Critical Installation Conflicts

**1. Undefined Hanging Specifications (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** Cable length TBD (To Be Determined)
- **Issue:** Number of hanging points TBD
- **Status:** NOT FINALIZED
- **Impact:** Cannot finalize installation until hanging details confirmed
- **Notes on Pages:** 1, 2, 3

**2. Hanging Cable and Hardware**
- **Status:** "SUPPLIED BY OTHERS" - not included in this scope
- **Coordination Required:** Separate procurement/coordination needed
- **Risk:** Potential for incompatible hanging hardware

**3. Shipping/Assembly Conflicts**
- Multiple notes indicate items "TO BE SHIPPED LOOSE"
- Joiner block assembly (Page 7): "THIS ASSEMBLY TO BE SHIPPED LOOSE"
- Item 58 on Page 4: "NOTE: TO BE SHIPPED LOOSE"
- **Coordination Required:** Field assembly required, installer competency critical

### Dimensional Concerns

**4. Beam Layout Discrepancies**
Page 5 shows assembly layout with specific beam positions, but individual beam spacing and joiner block locations need field verification:
- Beams P, O, N, M, L, K arranged on one axis
- Beams A-G arranged with specific spacing patterns
- **Verification Required:** Confirm actual assembly sequence matches layout

**5. Part Number Inconsistencies**
Possible numbering confusion:
- Page 5 lists Beam K as "SAF-TRE-001-A11" (115")
- Page 11 shows Beam K assembly as "SAF-TRE-001-A06"
- Page 5 lists Beam L as "SAF-TRE-001-A12" (106")
- Page 11 shows Beam L assembly as "SAF-TRE-001-A05"
- **Action Required:** Verify correct part numbers before fabrication

### Weight and Structural Concerns

**6. Approximate Weight Notation**
- Weight listed as "APPROXIMATE: 380 LBS"
- **Concern:** Actual weight should be calculated, not approximate, for structural loading
- **Coordination Required:** Verify with J.H. Cohoon Engineering structural calculations

**7. Hanging Point Loading**
Per Page 3 specifications:
- Maximum spacing between U-channel hanging points: 8'-0" O/C
- Maximum distance from end: 3'-0"
- **Red dots indicate approximate locations** (may be adjusted for site conditions)
- **Structural Concern:** Field adjustment of hanging points could alter loading distribution
- **Verification Required:** Any adjustment must be approved by structural engineer

## SUMMARY

This is a comprehensive 29-page drawing set for a large suspended retail display/signage structure for the Safeway Evolution project. The assembly measures approximately 45' x 26' with a height of 9"-12", weighing approximately 380 lbs. It consists of 16 different beam configurations (A-P) ranging from 74" to 238" in length, manufactured from INFINITY1-2-5X10 material, connected with joiner blocks and suspended from ceiling-mounted cables (by others).

**Critical Issues Requiring Resolution:**
- Hanging cable specifications (length and number of points) are undefined
- Part number discrepancies need verification
- Fire ratings for materials must be confirmed
- J.H. Cohoon Engineering letter (Sept. 28, 2023) must be reviewed

The drawing set is well-detailed with comprehensive parts lists, flat patterns, assembly views, and extrusion cut lists. Current revision (Rev 6) is approved for manufacturing but installation cannot proceed until hanging specifications are finalized and structural engineering coordination is complete.
