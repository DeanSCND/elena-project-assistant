## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Finish Transition Complexity**
   - Multiple finish types converging at department boundaries (e.g., Meat Sales/HMR interface)
   - Coordination required between PT6, PT7, PT8, FRP1, WT1, and PL13 dado transitions
   - Risk: Misalignment of finish heights where departments meet

2. **Cooler Box Panel Interface**
   - Cooler panels interface with multiple finish types
   - Note states "COOLER BOX PANEL" without specific finish material
   - Potential conflict: Wall finish termination details at cooler panel edges not fully specified

3. **Decor Panel Coordination**
   - 4'-10"H vinyl decor panels (Produce, Seafood, Meat, HMR, Pharmacy, Floral, Dairy, Bakery, Deli)
   - Different datum heights across departments
   - Risk: Inconsistent top-of-decor elevations may affect paint/finish alignment
   - Special coordination needed for "Rachelle Bery decor panel" and "Floral panel by TC"

4. **Bulkhead Height Variations**
   - PT6 typically painted from U/S bulkhead to datum, but bulkhead heights vary
   - 8'-6" AFF noted in some areas
   - Potential conflict: Bulkhead U/S elevations not consistently dimensioned

5. **Wall Dado Height Consistency**
   - PL13 wall dado specified at 4'-0" AFF in most areas
   - PL3 wall dado also at 4'-0" AFF in pharmacy/checkout areas
   - Question: Are PL3 and PL13 different materials or just different specifications?
   - Coordination needed with millwork/casework at counters

6. **Equipment Blocking Requirements**
   - Eyewash station, floor scale, water filter, mixers noted
   - No specific blocking or backing details on this finish drawing
   - Risk: Wall finishes may need to accommodate equipment mounting not shown

7. **Plywood Backing Areas**
   - "PLYWOOD FROM FINISHED FLOOR TO 8'-0" A.F.F." noted in receiving, storage, back-of-house
   - PT6 painted from T/O plywood to U/S ceiling
   - Potential conflict: Plywood backing extent/limits not clearly delineated in all areas

8. **Mezzanine Access Coordination**
   - Stairs noted with "UP 19R" and "DN 19R"
   - Wall finishes at stair enclosures primarily PT1
   - Coordination needed with guardrails, handrails (not shown on this drawing)

### Inconsistencies

1. **Revision Notes vs. Plan**
   - Revision R1 states: "ADD BACKROOM WALL FINISHES"
   - Plan shows extensive backroom finishes, but some storage/mechanical areas may lack complete finish callouts

2. **Flip-up Notation**
   - "FLIP-UP" noted at two locations (Meat Prep, Deli Prep) without finish specification
   - Unclear if this refers to equipment, counter, or architectural element

3. **Legend vs. Plan Application**
   - Legend shows "X" symbol for wall dado
   - Plan uses text callouts (PL3, PL13) rather than symbol
   - Minor inconsistency in notation method

4. **Datum Reference Clarity**
   - "2.25"H DATUM BY TC BELOW U/S OF DECOR" - implies a small datum band
   - Not clear if this is a physical element or just a reference line
   - May cause confusion in field installation

### Coordination Requirements

1. **MEP Coordination**
   - 120VT receptacle @ 60" AFF noted (Consultant room)
   - Wall finishes must coordinate with electrical outlets, switches, data (not shown)
   - HVAC grilles, fire alarm devices, security devices will penetrate finishes

2. **Millwork/Casework Coordination**
   - Pharmacy counters: "ADD PL3 NOTES TO PHARMACY COUNTERS" (R1 revision)
   - Counter heights will interface with wall dado at 4'-0" AFF
   - Upper cabinets noted in pharmacy - finish coordination required

3. **Door/Frame Coordination**
   - Multiple door callouts (PV3 series, TO series, etc.)
   - Wall finishes must terminate properly at door frames
   - FRP/tile areas require specific trim at openings

4. **Structural Coordination**
   - "ALL COLUMNS IN SALES AREA TO BE PAINTED PT7 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED"
   - Column finish must coordinate with adjacent wall finishes
   - Some columns may interrupt finish patterns

5. **Ceiling Coordination**
   - Reference to F4.1 for ceiling finishes
   - Wall finishes terminate at various ceiling elements (structure, bulkheads, decor)
   - Critical coordination: T/O decor to ceiling interface

### Fire-Rated Requirements

**Potential Fire Separation Walls:**
- Cooler/freezer rooms may require fire-rated assemblies
- Mechanical/compressor room likely requires fire separation
- Exit stairs (19R) to mezzanines require fire-rated enclosures
- Wall finish materials must not compromise fire ratings

**FRP Panel Application:**
- Marlite FRP (P100 White) must meet flame spread/smoke developed ratings
- Typical FRP: Class A, B, or C rating depending on application
- Food prep areas may have specific requirements for cleanability and fire safety

### Accessibility & Barrier-Free Requirements

**Washroom Areas:**
- Universal washroom noted (BF W/M - barrier-free washroom men's?)
- Wall finishes must accommodate accessible fixtures, grab bars
- Height of wall protection may relate to wheelchair impact zones

**Public Areas:**
- Wall dado at 4'-0" AFF provides protection in public circulation
- Compliance with impact-resistant finish requirements in accessible routes

### Food Safety & Sanitation Codes

**Wet Area/Food Prep Finishes:**
- FRP1 specified in all food prep areas (produce, seafood, meat, HMR, deli, bakery prep)
- WT1 (wall tile) in coolers and wet areas
- Compliance with health department requirements for smooth, cleanable, non-absorbent surfaces

- Deli/Cheese Prep: FRP1 (sanitation critical)
- Bakery Prep (Scratch): FRP1 + WT1 (moisture from dough/washing)
- HMR Prep: FRP1 (hot food prep, grease splash)

### Plywood Backing Code Considerations

**8'-0" AFF Plywood:**
- Back-of-house areas (receiving, storage, corridor) have plywood to 8'-0" AFF
- Likely for impact resistance, cart/equipment protection
- Plywood must be fire-treated if within fire-rated assembly
- Painted finish (PT6) must be compatible with substrate

### Egress & Life Safety

**Exit Access:**
- Corridors require code-compliant finishes (flame spread ratings)
- Mezzanine stairs (19R) are exit stairs - enclosure finishes must meet code
- "DN 19R" notation indicates egress path

**Occupancy Separation:**
- Receiving/back-of-house vs. sales floor may require separation
- Staff areas (lunch room, offices) vs. public areas
- Finish materials must maintain required fire resistance

### Specific Code Items Noted

1. **Eyewash Station** (Pharmacy prep)
   - Required by code for areas with chemical/hazardous material handling
   - Wall finish must accommodate installation

2. **Clearances**
   - 1.5 metre clearance (receiving)
   - 1M clearance (mezzanine)
