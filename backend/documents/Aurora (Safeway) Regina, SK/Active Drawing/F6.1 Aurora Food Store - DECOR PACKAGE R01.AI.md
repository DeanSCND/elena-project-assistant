## Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Issues Requiring Verification

1. **Stairs Location**:
   - "UP 19R" stairs shown with "DN" at bottom
   - No clear indication of destination (second floor? mezzanine? basement?)
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify with architectural plans if this store has multiple levels or if stairs are for service access only

2. **Electrical Coordination**:
   - Only one electrical note: "120VT REC @60"AFF" in pharmacy
   - Extensive refrigeration loads not detailed on this drawing
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Confirm all refrigeration power requirements with electrical consultant drawings

3. **HVAC Coordination**:
   - Multiple walk-in coolers/freezers shown
   - No indication of mechanical systems, ductwork, or condensing units
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Cross-reference with mechanical drawings for refrigeration racks, RTUs, and duct routing

4. **Plumbing Coordination**:
   - Eyewash station noted in HMR area
   - Pot washer in bakery
   - Floor drains likely required in all prep areas
   - Water filter noted in bakery
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify plumbing rough-ins with plumbing consultant

5. **Graphic Overlap Concerns**:
   - Multiple "SEAFOOD MEAT GRAPHIC" callouts in same general area - may indicate wall AND soffit applications
   - "PHARMACY DECAL" vs "PHARMACY GRAPHIC" - clarify size/application differences
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Refer to enlarged details and graphic specifications for exact placement

6. **Door Swings & Circulation**:
   - This plan type typically doesn't show door swings
   - Heavy customer traffic zones (checkouts, vestibule, seating) need clear egress
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify door hardware, panic devices, and ADA compliance on architectural plans

7. **Equipment Footprint Verification**:
   - "Flip-up" counters noted in meat and bakery - verify clearances
   - 80 qt mixer and spiral mixer placement - verify utilities
   - Floor scale location - verify structural support if required
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Obtain equipment cut sheets for all major items

8. **Casework Dimensions**:
   - Multiple similar model numbers (e.g., RL3D, RL4D, RL5D) - verify exact dimensions
   - Dunnage shelf heights specified at 5'AFF - confirm ADA reach range compliance where applicable
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Obtain manufacturer's data for all refrigerated and dry fixtures

9. **Back-of-House Flow**:
   - Receiving area (20 pallets) must accommodate delivery trucks
   - Corridor connects receiving to production areas
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify receiving door size, dock height, and truck turning radius on site plan

10. **Seating Area**:
    - Shown near front checkouts but no furniture specified on this sheet
    - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Confirm if furniture package is on separate FF&E schedule

### Notes on Revision History

**Revision R0 (2024.07.22)**: First draft

**Revision R1 (2024.12.03)**:
- Removed various notes (transferred to matrix chart F0.2)
- Updated Meat & Seafood graphic extent
- Updated Rachelle Bery graphic extent
- Updated Cheese & Deli signage

**CONCERN**: The revision updated graphic extents - ensure field conditions match R1 scope, not R0.

## Additional Observations

### Branding Strategy
The store features multiple sub-brands:
- **Rachelle Bery**: Health & wellness premium section
- **Bella Baguette**: Premium bakery line (per graphic)
- **"Our Kitchen"**: HMR/prepared foods branding
- **"Ingredients for Life"**: Overall store tagline/philosophy

### Customer Experience Design
- Prominent produce placement at entry (150'-0" frontage) - industry best practice
- Seating area encourages dwell time near checkouts
- Pharmacy with consultant room suggests healthcare services
- Floral department visible from entry and near checkout path

### Operational Efficiency
- Centralized receiving (20 pallet capacity) with corridor access to all prep areas
- Back-of-house offices clustered (Store Manager, Dept. Manager, eLEARN, Cash)
- Separate prep areas prevent cross-contamination
- Multiple stock rooms for department-specific inventory

### Sustainability/Specialty Features
- Bulk food section (reduces packaging)
- Rachelle Bery natural/organic section
- Water filter in bakery (quality control)
- Seasonal drop zone (flexibility for local/seasonal products)

   - Structural review (floor scale, equipment loads, stair design)
   - Code compliance review with AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction)
   - Graphic installer pre-construction meeting

3. **Submittals:**
   - Equipment cut sheets for all refrigeration units
