## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Drawing Reference Uncertainty
1. **FS4.2??** - Drawing reference includes question marks, indicating uncertainty or need for clarification

### Coordination Notes Required

#### Wall Dado Installations
Multiple "WALL DADO TO BE INSTALLED" callouts without specific height or material specifications on plan:
- Seafood Cooler area
- Vestibule area
- Grocery Freezer area
- Seating Area
- HMR Prep area
- Seasonal Drop Zone
- HABA area
- Pharmacy Prep Area
- Consultant Room area
- Floral area
- Staff Mezzanine - Lunch Room (2 locations)

**POTENTIAL ISSUE**: Height specifications not shown on plan (referenced to construction details). Verify consistency across all locations.

#### Architectural Coordination
11 instances of "REFER TO ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS FOR DETAILS" suggest:
- Millwork details not fully shown on this drawing
- Potential for conflicts between millwork and architectural elements
- Need for coordination between trades

**RECOMMENDATION**: Cross-check all referenced architectural details before millwork fabrication.

#### Clearance Conflicts
Potential clearance issues to verify:
1. **Receiving Area**: 1.5 metre clearance - verify against door swings and equipment
2. **Compressor Room**: 1M clearance - verify against code requirements for mechanical room access
3. **Stairs**: 5'-10" clearance noted - verify headroom compliance with code

#### Equipment Placement
Several areas show equipment without dimensioned locations:
- FLIP-UP counters (multiple locations) - exact hinge locations not shown
- FLOOR SCALE (Bakery) - exact placement unclear
- POT WASHER - connection points not dimensioned
- EYEWASH STATION - mounting height shown as note only

### Potential Specification Conflicts

#### General Contractor vs. Sobeys Supplier Scope
Legend indicates split responsibility:
- Some millwork: Sobeys supplied, GC installed
- Other millwork: GC supplied AND installed
- Metal fascia: Sobeys supplied and installed

**COORDINATION REQUIRED**: Clear scope delineation needed to avoid gaps or overlaps in responsibility.

#### Shelving Specifications
Multiple shelving callouts with varying specifications:
- Some show "COOLER SHELVING" (cold-rated)
- Others show generic "SHELVING"
- Depths vary: 18"W, 18"B
- Verify if "W" (width) and "B" (breadth/depth) are equivalent or different specifications
