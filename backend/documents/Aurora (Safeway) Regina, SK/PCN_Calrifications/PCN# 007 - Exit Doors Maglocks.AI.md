## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### 4.1 Potential Conflicts

**Fire Door Positive Latching**:
- **Issue**: Article 3.1.8.15 requires fire doors to positively latch at all times
- **Concern**: Electromagnetic locks alone do NOT satisfy positive latching requirements
- **Resolution Required**: Special care needed in design if maglocks used on fire doors
- **Status**: Not explicitly addressed in PCN - requires verification of door fire ratings

**Hardware Group Confusion**:
- Group #13 deleted but doors #191A/#191B reassigned to Group #12
- Note states "DELAYED EGRESS TIED TO FIRE ALARM" but item .5 states these doors "remain with localized alarm bar, no delayed egress"
- **Potential Conflict**: Contradictory requirements for warehouse exit doors
- **Requires Clarification**: Whether #191A/#191B have delayed egress or only localized alarm

**Electric Strike vs. Electromagnetic Lock**:
- Advisory explicitly prohibits electric strikes as substitute for maglocks
- Electric strikes incorporate latches/pins (not permitted for restricted egress)
- **Coordination Required**: Ensure Gunnebo hardware complies with maglock requirements

### 4.2 Coordination Requirements

**Architectural/Electrical Coordination**:
- Electrical scope (Section 2.0) must wire and connect maglocks per architectural requirements (Section 1.0)
- Master key switch at Customer Service Desk controls all maglocks
- Interconnection with door access control system required
- Fire alarm system integration required

**Signage Coordination**:
- Visual signs on doors (architectural scope)
- Tactile signs on walls (architectural scope)
- Emergency lighting must illuminate both (electrical scope)
- Heights must comply with accessibility standards (900-1100mm)

**Fire Alarm Coordination**:
- Maglocks must release on fire alarm signal
- 2-stage systems: Alert signal does NOT require release; alarm signal DOES
- Manual reset required after fire alarm release
- Bypass switch for testing must provide visual/audible indication

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### 5.1 NBC 2015 Compliance Requirements

**Sentence 3.4.6.16.(5) - Electromagnetic Lock Requirements** (Applied to this project):

✓ **Permitted Occupancies**: All except Group F, Division 1 (industrial high-hazard)
✓ **Fire Alarm System**: Building must be equipped
✓ **Release Triggers**:
  - Fire alarm signal (alarm, not alert in 2-stage systems)
  - Loss of power controlling locks
  - Manual switch by authorized person

**Pull Stations** (for Sentence 6, not used here):
- Red pull stations connected to fire alarm
- Within 0.5m of door
- Immediate release of specific door
- Transparent box with alarm permitted to reduce false alarms

**Electric Strikes**:
- NOT permitted as maglock substitute for restricted egress/exit
- May be used to restrict entry (not egress) in limited circumstances
- Must not compromise egress requirements from occupied spaces

### 5.5 Fire Safety Compliance

**Fire Alarm Integration**:
- Maglocks release on alarm signal
- Interconnection required
- Testing bypass switch permitted with visual/audible indication
- Manual pull stations trigger building alarm AND door release (if applicable)

**Fire Doors**:
- Must positively latch per Article 3.1.8.15
- Electromagnetic lock alone insufficient
- Additional latching hardware required
- Fire-rated mounting brackets specified for Compressor Room #300B

**Emergency Power**:
- Maglocks release on loss of emergency power
- Emergency lighting required for doors and signage
- Backup power must maintain code compliance

### 5.6 Occupant Load Considerations

**Panic Hardware Requirements** (CAN/ULC-S132):

- Exit stair shaft doors in buildings with occupant load > 100
- Group F, Division 1 exit doors
- Note: Saskatchewan amendments apply

## 8. Technical Clarifications Required

### 8.1 Questions for Design Team

1. **Fire Door Ratings**: Which of the affected doors (#104, #119B, #190A, #191A, #191B) are fire-rated? Fire doors require positive latching hardware in addition to maglocks.

2. **Hardware Group #13 vs #12**: Clarify the apparent contradiction between the note "DELAYED EGRESS TIED TO FIRE ALARM" for Group #12 and item .5 stating warehouse doors (#191A, #191B) "remain with localized alarm bar, no delayed egress."

3. **Occupancy Classification**: Confirm occupancy classification to ensure Sentence 3.4.6.16.(5) applicability (not Group F, Division 1).

4. **Occupant Load**: Confirm occupant loads for areas served by maglocked doors to verify panic hardware requirements.

5. **Emergency Crossover**: Are any affected floors required to meet emergency crossover floor requirements per Article 3.4.6.16.(18)?

6. **Master Switch Location**: Confirm Customer Service Desk is "constantly attended" and accessible to authorized personnel during all operating hours.

7. **Backup Power**: Specify backup power arrangements for maglocks and confirm generator transfer time ≤ 15 seconds.

8. **Door #100A**: Listed for Keynote #32 (tactile exit sign) but not listed for maglock installation. Confirm this door is NOT delayed egress.

### 8.2 Coordination Items

1. **Gunnebo Submittal**: Obtain fire-rated bracket specifications for Compressor Room door #300B.

2. **Hardware Schedules**: Update drawing A9.0 to reflect all changes (delete Group #13, modify Groups #2 and #12, delete door #119A, add Detail 2A and 2B).

3. **Large Scale Plans**: Update A2.1-A2.4 with Keynote #32 locations.

4. **Electrical Plans**: Update E3.0 to show maglock locations, master switch, fire alarm interconnection, and Keynote #8 modifications.

5. **Access Control**: Coordinate maglock operation with door access control system specifications.

6. **Fire Alarm**: Coordinate release logic, testing bypass switch, and visual/audible indicators.

## 12. Risk Assessment

### 12.1 High Priority Risks

**Fire Door Latching**:
- **Risk**: Maglocks on fire doors without positive latching violates Article 3.1.8.15
- **Impact**: Code violation, failed inspection, fire safety compromise
- **Mitigation**: Verify fire door ratings; specify additional latching hardware

**Hardware Group Contradiction**:
- **Risk**: Unclear requirements for doors #191A, #191B (delayed vs. non-delayed egress)
- **Impact**: Incorrect installation, non-compliant operation
- **Mitigation**: Issue clarification bulletin before procurement

### 12.2 Medium Priority Risks

**Backup Power Transfer Time**:
- **Risk**: Generator transfer > 15 seconds causes code violation
- **Impact**: All maglocks must release during transfer
- **Mitigation**: Verify generator specs or provide UPS for maglocks

**Signage Fabrication**:
- **Risk**: Custom CSA B651 tactile signage with Braille has long lead time
- **Impact**: Schedule delay
- **Mitigation**: Early procurement, confirm fabricator capabilities

### 12.3 Low Priority Risks

**Master Switch Location**:
- **Risk**: Customer Service Desk may not be constantly attended
- **Impact**: Code interpretation issue with City of Regina
- **Mitigation**: Confirm staffing or relocate switch

**Testing Coordination**:
- **Risk**: Complex integration testing (fire alarm, access control, maglocks)
- **Impact**: Extended commissioning period
- **Mitigation**: Detailed testing protocol, coordinate trades
