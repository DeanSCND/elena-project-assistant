## 6. Technical Analysis & Observations

### Capacity Analysis

**Service Entrance Capacity**:
- Original: 5 runs × 600 MCM Al. ≈ 2,125A theoretical capacity (if paralleled)
- Revised: 6 runs × 600 MCM Al. ≈ 2,550A theoretical capacity
- Main Breaker: 1600A
- **Delta**: Addition of 6th run provides ~20% capacity increase
- **Reasoning**: TSASK likely identified insufficient margin or derating factors (burial, ambient temperature, conduit fill)

**Load Summary** (from diagram):
- Two 450 KVA transformers = 900 KVA total at 600V = ~866A
- Compressor Rack A: 244 kW ≈ 410A @ 600V
- Multiple RTUs, panels, and equipment
- **Total connected load**: Appears to approach or exceed 1600A when diversity factors applied

**Refrigeration Load Concentration**:
- Heavy refrigeration load: Panels R1L through R4L plus R1M
- Compressor Rack A (244 kW) is single largest load
- **Implication**: Grocery store refrigeration is critical and represents majority of electrical load

### System Architecture Observations

**Dual Transformer Configuration**:
- Splitting 600V distribution into two 450 KVA transformers
- Each transformer "choked" to 400A primary (332 KVA effective)
- **Benefit**: Redundancy, allows maintenance on one transformer while other carries critical loads
- **Design**: SD-1 and SD-2 loads appear balanced

**Emergency Power Strategy**:
- Small 22 kW generator for "non-essential" loads only
- **Implication**: Critical refrigeration loads NOT on emergency power
- **Alternative**: Refrigeration likely has alternative protection (compressor hold-over, backup systems)

**Voltage System Design**:
- **600V Primary**: Main distribution at 347/600V for efficiency over long runs and large loads
- **208V Secondary**: Standard 120/208V for lighting, receptacles, and smaller equipment
- **Benefit**: Reduced copper size for given kW load at higher voltage

### Installation Complexity Factors

**Mezzanine Service Entry**:
- Service enters at ground level, rises to second floor mezzanine
- **Complexity**: Vertical run with heavy conductors, requires substantial support
- **Coordination**: Concrete shaft must accommodate 6 parallel runs

**Buried Service Entry**:
- Service conductors buried from pad-mount transformer to building
- **Consideration**: Saskatchewan climate requires appropriate burial depth for frost protection
- **Unknown**: Frost line depth and burial depth specification (in referenced details)

This PCN documents a **regulatory compliance change** mandated by TSASK to increase service entrance capacity from 5 to 6 runs of 600 MCM ACWU90 aluminum conductors. The change impacts the main service feed to a 1600A electrical distribution system serving a full-service grocery store.

**Key Technical Points**:
- Service capacity increased by ~20% to satisfy AHJ requirements
- Affects buried underground installation and vertical rise to second floor mezzanine
- Requires coordination with SaskPower utility transformer
- Installation must comply with Detail 6, Diagram D10, Table 10B (not included)

**Critical Coordination**:
- Verify concrete shaft and penetration capacity for 6th conductor run
- Confirm grounding system adequacy (potential undersizing identified)
- Review complete load calculations and protective device coordination
- Schedule utility and AHJ coordination meetings

**Code Compliance Status**:
- Change implements TSASK-required modification for CEC compliance
- Transformer protection explicitly compliant with CEC 26-256(3)
- Grounding conductor size requires verification
- Arc flash study and coordination study recommended

This modification represents a significant service entrance capacity increase driven by regulatory review, suggesting the original design had insufficient margin for the connected load or failed to properly account for Saskatchewan-specific derating factors (burial conditions, ambient temperature, or loading diversity).
