This PCN adds significant exterior lighting and signage elements to the Aurora Grocery Store project. The changes are well-documented across four electrical drawings (E0.2, E0.3, E1.0, E2.0) and include:

**Scope Summary**:
- 19 additional exterior light fixtures (3 Type X1, 16 Type X2)
- 4 new exterior signs requiring power
- Multiple billboard circuits (8 total for North and West billboards)
- 5 circuit breaker additions across 2 panels (2A and C2)
- 1 circuit spare credit (Panel C1)

**Critical Path Items**:
1. Fixture specifications and lead times
2. Load calculations and code compliance verification
3. GFCI protection specification
4. Scope clarification with site lighting panel installer
5. Coordination with signage supplier
6. Panel capacity verification

**Risk Assessment**:
- **High Risk**: Exterior lighting circuit loading, scope boundaries, GFCI compliance
- **Medium Risk**: Panel capacity, weatherproofing, energy code compliance
- **Low Risk**: Material availability (if standard products used)

**Recommendation**: Approve PCN subject to resolution of Outstanding Questions (Section 8) and completion of load calculations. Schedule coordination meeting with all stakeholders before proceeding with rough-in.
