## 7. TECHNICAL NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### Load Density Concerns

**Panel R1M Loading:**
- 200A panel serving 100+ refrigeration circuits (52 case circuits + evaporators + accessories)
- Even at 15A per circuit with diversity, panel may be near capacity
- Recommend load calculation verification to confirm panel adequacy
- Phase balancing critical with this many circuits

**Compressor Room Panel Concentration:**
- Room 300 houses panels: 2A (1200A), SD-1 (400A), SD-2 (200A), R1M (200A), Z (100A)
- Total panel ampacity: 2100A+ in one room
- Requires substantial ventilation/cooling to prevent panel overheating
- Working clearances may be challenging with this panel density

### Wire Sizing Strategy

- Smaller circuits (#12 wire for 20A control panel) indicates cost optimization
- Larger feeders (#1 for 125A RTU-1) properly sized for load
- Temperature derating in compressor room may require ampacity verification
- Future capacity consideration: no indication of spare conduit or upsize provisions

### Coordination Drawing Gaps

**Missing Details:**
- Equipment schedule details (HP, voltage, phase, FLA for each unit)
- Conduit routing plan (especially underslab vs. overhead)
- Panel location plan for Compressor Room 300
- Wire and circuit identification schedule/standard
- Voltage drop calculations
- Short circuit coordination study
- Arc flash analysis

### Installation Sequence Implications

**Critical Path Items:**
1. Underslab conduit rough-in (before slab pour) - General Note 12 minimizes this
2. Walk-in cooler/freezer installation (before junction box final locations)
3. Display case installation (before final circuit connections)
4. Panel installation and energization (after rough-in inspections)
5. EMS commissioning (after all equipment connected)
6. Final testing and balancing

**Potential Delays:**
- Credit negotiation for downsized circuits
- Field verification of stub-up locations (General Note 9)
- Coordination meetings with multiple trades
- Equipment lead times if specifications changed

### Quality Control Considerations

**Testing Requirements:**
- Megger testing of all refrigeration circuits (damp location concern)
- GFCI testing for all anti-sweat circuits
- Panel phasing and rotation verification
- Voltage drop testing under load
- Ground fault testing
- Fire alarm verification report (Fire Alarm Riser Note 9)

**Commissioning Checklist:**
- All circuit labeling complete and accurate
- Panel directories updated and accurate
- Equipment disconnects installed and labeled
- GFCI devices tested and operational
- EMS system programmed and communicating
- Leak detection system tested
- Emergency condensing unit tested
- All defrost circuits operational
- Phase balancing verified

**Potential Credits (Item 2.1):**
- "Any electrical items (circuit breakers, wiring, etc.) that are no longer required"
- Unquantified - depends on original design
- Could be significant if entire panels or major circuits eliminated
- Requires detailed comparison to original contract documents

### Potential Additional Costs

**Not Mentioned but Likely:**
- Engineering time for revised calculations and drawings
- Contractor time for RFP response and pricing
- Field coordination meetings
- Potential demolition if original work already in place
- Re-inspection fees if rough-in already inspected
- Testing and commissioning adjustments
- As-built drawing updates

### Budget Considerations

- Cover page requires cost breakdown from contractor
- No allowance or budget estimate provided in PCN
- Schedule impact could trigger liquidated damages
- Owner credit may offset contractor change order markup
- Net cost impact: Unknown without contractor pricing

6. **Schedule Coordination Meeting** - All trades + owner + engineer present

### Design Clarifications Needed

1. What is the refrigerant type? (Impacts hazardous location classification)
2. Is emergency condensing unit on emergency power or generator?
3. What is the specific labeling standard for circuit identification?
4. Are there spare circuits provided for future expansion?
5. What is the conduit routing strategy (overhead vs. underslab percentages)?
6. Has voltage drop been calculated for longest circuits?
7. Is arc flash analysis complete for panels?

### Document Requests

1. Original electrical drawings E0.2, E0.3, E4.0 (pre-revision)
2. Complete refrigeration equipment schedule
3. Condensing unit schedule with electrical specifications
4. Compressor room panel layout drawing

## 10. SUMMARY OF KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Primary Changes
- Compressor rack control panel circuit downsized: 25A/10AWG → 20A/12AWG (credit to owner)
- Evaporator system circuitry revised per updated drawings E0.2, E0.3, E4.0
- Credit anticipated for eliminated electrical items (amount TBD)

### System Scope
- Large-scale grocery store refrigeration system with 50+ display cases
- Centralized compressor rack with distributed refrigeration
- Two-temperature system (medium and low temp)
- 13+ walk-in coolers/freezers
- Sophisticated EMS and leak detection systems
- Emergency backup refrigeration capacity

### Critical Coordination
- Electrical with refrigeration contractor (ongoing)
- Electrical with cooler/freezer supplier (junction box locations)
- Electrical with mechanical (underslab routing, compressor room layout)
- All trades with owner representative (final approvals)
- Contractor with AHJ (permit amendment, inspections)

### Code Compliance Highlights
- Canadian Electrical Code compliance required throughout
- GFCI protection mandatory for anti-sweat circuits (30mA fixed-trip)
- Conduit sealing required at thermal barriers
- Fire alarm integration per CAN/ULC S524
- Motor disconnect and overload protection per CEC Section 28

### Outstanding Issues
- Cost impact unknown pending contractor pricing
- Schedule impact not assessed
- Extent of revisions unclear without original drawings
- Equipment specifications incomplete in provided documents
- Field conditions (slab status, rough-in progress) unknown
