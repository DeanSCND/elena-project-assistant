## 1. Visual Interpretation

### Floor Plan Analysis (page001_img002.jpeg)

**Spatial Layout:**
- The drawing shows a plan view of the CLEAN-UP AREA and adjacent rooms
- Door #194 is marked on the left side (indicated by reference number)
- The clean-up area contains:
  - A central fixture (appears to be a mop sink or utility sink) shown in tan/beige color
  - Two floor slopes indicated by directional arrows
  - Multiple column references (C2, C3, A2)
  - Wall construction notation

**Color Coding System:**
- **Blue elements**: Existing plumbing fixtures and doors (shown on left side)
  - Blue door with blue circular hardware indicator
  - Blue plumbing fixture (sink/wash station)
- **Orange/Tan elements**: New or modified elements
  - Orange diagonal striped area on the right side (likely indicating new construction or modification zone)
  - Tan/beige sink fixture in center
  - Orange circle notation (possibly floor drain or fixture)
- **Yellow elements**: Critical clearance or dimension indicators
  - Yellow curved zone at bottom showing 8'-8" clearance arc
  - Yellow vertical element marked "198"
  - Yellow dimension notation showing 2'-5"
- **Black/Gray elements**: Standard building elements (walls, columns, existing features)

**Key Visual Elements:**
- **Door #193**: Located on the upper right side of the clean-up area, providing access to/from the clean-up area
- **Slopes**: Two floor slopes indicated with directional arrows (one pointing toward central fixture, one toward door #193)
- **Column Grid**: Shows structural columns labeled A2, C2, and C3 at various locations
- **Clearance Arc**: Yellow 8'-8" radius arc at bottom, likely indicating door swing clearance for door #198
- **Dimension**: 2'-5" dimension shown in yellow on the right side

**Spatial Relationships:**
- Clean-up area is bounded by structural grid lines
- Door #193 positioned to provide access from adjacent space
- Multiple slope directions indicate drainage pattern toward central fixture and toward door area
- Coordination with columns C2 and A2 at the perimeter

## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Coordination Issues

1. **Floor Slope Coordination**:
   - Two slope indicators in clean-up area suggest drainage pattern
   - New Door #193 location must coordinate with floor slope direction (slope arrow points toward door area)
   - Verify threshold detail at Door #193 accommodates floor slope and drainage

2. **Structural Coordination**:
   - Door #193 location relative to column C2 (shown at upper right)
   - Verify header/lintel coordination with structural framing
   - Confirm wall location aligns with structural grid

3. **Plumbing Coordination**:
   - Central fixture (mop sink) with floor slopes
   - Floor drain locations relative to new door
   - Potential for water intrusion at new door threshold

4. **Clearance Verification**:
   - Door swing direction not explicitly shown for Door #193
   - Verify door swing doesn't conflict with:
     - Central mop sink fixture
     - Adjacent door operations (#194, #198)
     - Required clearances for clean-up area functions

5. **Hardware Coordination**:
   - Hardware Group #4 specifications need to be verified
   - Confirm compatibility with zero-hour fire rating
   - Verify if keying/access control coordination required

### Missing Information

1. **Door swing direction**: Not indicated on plan for Door #193
2. **Threshold type**: Not specified (critical for sloped floor condition)
3. **Wall type/construction**: Not detailed in PCN
4. **Frame anchor details**: Not specified for HM frame installation
5. **Ceiling height**: Not shown (relevant for 7'-0" door height)

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Fire & Life Safety

1. **Fire Rating**:
   - Zero Hour FRR specified (non-rated door/frame assembly)
   - Confirms clean-up area is not part of fire-rated compartment
   - Verify consistency with building's fire separation requirements

2. **Egress Considerations**:
   - Clean-up area appears to be a small service room
   - Door #193 may serve as access or secondary egress
   - Verify if Hardware Group #4 includes panic/exit hardware (if required)

3. **Door Size Compliance**:
   - 3'-2" (38") clear width
   - Meets minimum egress width requirements if serving as exit
   - Adequate for service/utility room access

### Accessibility

1. **Door Width**:
   - 3'-2" nominal provides approximately 36" clear opening (typical HM frame)
   - Meets accessibility requirements for minimum 32" clear width

2. **Hardware**:
   - Hardware Group #4 must comply with accessible hardware requirements
   - Verify lever hardware, mounting heights, and operating force

3. **Threshold**:
   - Maximum 1/2" threshold height (3/4" if beveled)
   - Critical coordination with sloped floor condition
   - May require custom threshold detail

### Building Code

1. **Clean-Up Area Classification**:
   - Service/utility room (non-occupiable)
   - Likely classified as ancillary space to main retail use
   - Plumbing fixture and floor slopes indicate janitor/cleaning function

2. **Door Hardware**:
   - Hardware Group #4 should specify:
     - Lockset/latchset type
     - Closer (if required)
     - Kick plate/protection (if required)
     - ADA-compliant lever hardware

3. **Floor Drainage**:
   - Floor slopes indicate floor drain system
   - Verify waterproofing at door threshold
   - Consider door sweep or drip edge detail

---

## 6. Construction Considerations

### Scope of Work

1. **Field verify existing conditions** at door opening location
2. **Demolition** (if any):
   - Remove existing wall section
   - Prepare opening for new door frame
3. **Framing**:
   - Install/modify wall framing for 3'-2" x 7'-0" opening
   - Install header/lintel as required
4. **Door/Frame Installation**:
   - Install HM frame (grouted/anchored per standards)
   - Hang HM door with Hardware Group #4
   - Adjust and align for proper operation
5. **Finishes**:
   - Patch/repair wall finishes both sides
   - Coordinate floor finish at threshold
   - Touch-up paint/finish as required

### Coordination Requirements

- **Structural**: Verify header requirement, coordinate with column C2
- **Plumbing**: Protect existing floor drains and slopes
- **Electrical**: Coordinate if access control hardware required
- **Finishes**: Match existing wall finishes both sides
- **Hardware**: Verify keying with owner

## 8. Questions for Clarification

1. **What is the door swing direction for Door #193?** (Critical for clearances and operation)
2. **What is the wall construction type** receiving the new door frame?
3. **Is a floor drain located near Door #193?** (Shown as orange circle on plan?)
4. **What threshold detail is required** to accommodate floor slope?
5. **Does Hardware Group #4 include a door closer?** (Typical for service rooms)
6. **What is the finish specification** for HM door and frame? (Paint, factory finish, etc.)
7. **Is access control integration required** for Door #193?
8. **What is the room on the opposite side** of Door #193? (Affects swing direction and hardware)
