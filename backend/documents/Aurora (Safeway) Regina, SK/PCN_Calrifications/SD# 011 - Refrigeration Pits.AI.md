## 4. Identified Conflicts & Issues

### CRITICAL NON-COMPLIANCE ISSUE

**Issue #1: Missing Liner Securing System**
- **Severity**: HIGH - Requires consultant review and approval
- **Description**: Refrigeration pits do NOT have:
  1. Liner securing rods that can be cast in concrete (as shown in A7.0 and S1.3)
  2. Adjustable aluminum frame system (as detailed in A7.0 and S1.3)
- **Contract Requirement**: Manufacturer specified in Section 11 94 00 in project manual
- **Proposed Solution**: Alternative installation method submitted (see below)
- **Status**: Awaiting consultant confirmation if this is acceptable

### Installation Method Variance

**Contract Documents Expectation** (per A7.0 & S1.3):
- Liner securing rods cast into concrete
- Adjustable upward aluminum frame

**Proposed Manufacturer Method**:
1. Install refrigeration pits on granular base to set height and location
2. Screw screws into side of pit before pouring concrete (to prevent movement)
3. Pour concrete around the pit
4. Remove the frame

**Potential Issues**:
- Height adjustment capability may be limited compared to specified system
- No cast-in securing rods may affect pit stability
- Installation sequence differs from architectural/structural details
- Temporary screw fixings vs. permanent cast-in rods

### Dimensional Coordination Concerns
- **Frame vs. Plate Size**: 24.87" outer frame with 23.875" plate creates 0.9975" gap (approximately 1")
  - Needs verification this matches floor opening requirements on A7.0
  - May affect finished floor interface details

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Material Compliance
- **6061-T6 Aluminum (Lid)**: Standard structural aluminum alloy, meets ASTM B209
- **6063 Aluminum (Extrusion)**: Architectural aluminum alloy, meets ASTM B221
- **HDPE (Box)**: High-density polyethylene suitable for refrigeration applications
  - Resistant to refrigerants and low temperatures
  - Food-grade material compliance should be verified

### Safety Considerations
- **Checker Plate Surface**: Provides slip resistance for walking surface
- **Load Rating**: Not specified on submittal
  - Should verify if complies with floor live load requirements
  - Typical refrigeration areas may have equipment loading requirements
- **Edge Condition**: Aluminum extrusion provides finished edge to prevent trip hazard

### Installation Code Considerations
- **ACI 318 (Concrete)**: Screws into HDPE before concrete pour
  - Not a standard embedment detail
  - Structural engineer review recommended
- **Height Adjustment**: Lack of adjustability may create finished floor elevation issues
  - May require shimming or base adjustment in field
  - Could affect ADA compliance if floor transitions are affected

### Structural Concerns
- **No Cast-In Anchors**: Reliance on screws into HDPE walls
  - May not provide adequate lateral restraint
  - Concrete shrinkage could affect connection
  - Differential settlement concerns
- **Load Transfer**: Full bottom vs. open bottom affects how loads transfer to substrate
  - Granular base provides support
  - Should verify base preparation requirements

### Refrigeration System Compliance
- **Pit Access**: 24"x24" opening size
  - Should verify adequate for refrigeration line servicing
  - Equipment manufacturer coordination needed
- **Drainage**: No drainage provisions shown
  - Condensation management should be addressed
  - Full bottom may trap liquids

## 6. Recommendations for Review

### Action Items for Consultant (Chris Walbaum / Nejmark)

1. **PRIORITY 1 - Installation Method Approval**
   - Review and approve/reject alternative installation method
   - Compare proposed method to A7.0 and S1.3 details
   - Assess if height adjustment capability is adequate

2. **PRIORITY 2 - Structural Review**
   - Verify screw attachment method provides adequate anchorage
   - Confirm granular base is acceptable vs. cast-in securing rods
   - Review load rating requirements for pit assembly

3. **PRIORITY 3 - Coordination**
   - Verify 24.87" frame dimension coordinates with floor opening on A7.0
   - Check if HDPE material is acceptable vs. specified aluminum liner
   - Confirm full bottom vs. open bottom configuration

4. **PRIORITY 4 - Documentation**
   - Request load rating certification
   - Request material certifications (aluminum alloy and HDPE)
   - Verify food-grade compliance if required

### Suggested Drawing Markups
- Clarify final floor elevation relative to top of aluminum frame
- Add load rating to drawing
- Show granular base preparation requirements
- Detail screw type, size, and spacing for temporary installation fixings

## 7. Additional Technical Notes

### Fabrication Details
- **Welding**: Hot air welding for HDPE, TIG welding typical for aluminum
- **Finish**: Mill finish aluminum typical (no coating specified)
- **Tolerances**: "May vary slightly" - should request specific tolerances

### Installation Sequence Clarification Needed
- When are screws removed (if at all)?
- What fills screw holes after removal?
- How is final elevation verified before concrete pour?
- What happens if adjustment needed after concrete cure?

### Maintenance Considerations
- Checker plate lid appears removable for access
- No gasket or seal shown - may allow moisture/debris entry
- Cleaning access for pit interior not addressed

## 8. Summary Assessment

**Status**: AWAITING CONSULTANT REVIEW AND APPROVAL

This submittal presents a **significant deviation** from the contract documents regarding the installation method and frame system. While the manufacturer's product appears to be a standard refrigeration pit design with appropriate materials, the lack of cast-in securing rods and adjustable frame system requires explicit approval from the design team.

**Key Decision Point**: Can the alternate installation method provide equivalent performance to the specified system in terms of:
- Structural stability
- Height adjustment capability
- Long-term durability
- Coordination with adjacent construction

**Recommendation**: Issue as "REVIEWED AS NOTED" or "REVISE AND RESUBMIT" pending resolution of installation method variance and dimensional coordination confirmation.
