- **Installation Heights**:
  - 114'-10" (Rachelle Béry/Pharmacy) = approx. 14'-10" above grade
  - 115'-8" (SAFEWAY) = approx. 15'-8" above grade
- **Code Review Required**: City of Regina Zoning Bylaw for maximum sign area and height
- **Potential Issue**: Large sign area (38'-4" x 5'-0" = 191.7 sq ft for front entrance sign)

#### Life Safety

##### Electrical
- **CSA C22.1 Canadian Electrical Code**:
  - LED sign transformers/drivers must be CSA approved
  - Proper grounding required
  - Weatherproof connections in outdoor environment
  - GFCI protection may be required for maintenance outlets

##### Structural
- **NBC 2020 (National Building Code)**:
  - Wind load design per Part 4 Structural Design
  - Regina wind exposure category to be determined
  - Sign must be designed as exterior building element
  - Seismic restraint if required by structural engineer
  - Live load consideration for maintenance access

##### Fire Separation
- **No apparent conflicts**: Signage does not appear to compromise fire separations
- **Material Combustibility**:
  - Aluminum components: Non-combustible
  - Acrylic faces: Combustible but limited quantity
  - LED wiring: Must be rated for outdoor/sign use

#### Accessibility
- **No direct accessibility concerns**: Wall-mounted signage above head height
- **Maintenance Access**: Consider how signs will be serviced (lift equipment, roof access?)

#### Energy Code
- **LED Efficiency**: Modern LED signage typically code-compliant for energy efficiency
- **Controls**: May require astronomical time clock or photocell per energy code
- **Consideration**: Verify if signage lighting is included in building energy model

### Municipal Requirements

## 6. ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

### Drawing Quality
- **Clarity**: Well-detailed specifications for signage components
- **Completeness**: Missing some connection details that should be in shop drawings
- **Visual Communication**: Good use of dimensional drawings and material callouts
- **Color Information**: Adequate color specifications provided

### Budget/Pricing Considerations
- Large sign area (38'-4" front entrance sign) = significant material cost
- Multiple sign types (front entrance, west, north, Rachelle Béry, pharmacy) = 5 separate signs
- Custom fabrication required (halo-lit channel letters, back-lit logo, perforated panel)
- Two pre-approved contractors only = limited competitive bidding
- Structural support (knife plates, HSS) adds cost
- Electrical rough-in coordination required

### Schedule Implications
- Shop drawing preparation: 3-4 weeks after award
- Shop drawing review: 2-3 weeks
- Permit application: 2-4 weeks processing
- Fabrication lead time: 6-10 weeks typical for custom signage
- Installation: 1-2 weeks (weather dependent)
- **Critical Path**: Sign fabrication likely on critical path for building occupancy

### Constructability Notes
- 38'-4" wide sign panel will require large delivery vehicle and crane/lift for installation
- Winter installation challenging (LED performance, coating application, worker safety)
- Coordination with curtain wall installation sequence critical
- Access for installation (scaffolding, swing stage, or large boom lift required)

### Design Intent
- Prominent Safeway branding on three building elevations (East, West, North)
- Secondary branding for Rachelle Béry (specialty organic market section)
- Pharmacy identification as required by regulations
- Modern aesthetic with halo-lit letters (premium appearance vs. face-lit)
- White perforated background provides visual contrast and reduces visual mass

### Sustainability Considerations
- LED lighting = energy efficient vs. neon or fluorescent
- Aluminum components = recyclable at end of life
- Long-life LED reduces maintenance truck rolls
- Perforated panel reduces wind load = smaller structural requirements
