## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Critical Coordination Items

1. **Equipment Type Mismatch Resolution**:
   - **Issue**: Original design specified "Self Service Hot Foods" but actual equipment is "Full Service Hot Foods"
   - **Impact**: Different power requirements (3-phase vs 1-phase)
   - **Status**: Being corrected via this PCN
   - **Risk Level**: HIGH - Would have resulted in field incompatibility if not caught

2. **Panel Capacity Verification Required**:
   - **Issue**: Panel 'H' must accommodate change from 70A-3P to 70A-2P plus new 15A-1P circuit
   - **Action Required**: Verify Panel 'H' has available space for additional 15A-1P breaker
   - **Note**: May affect panel phasing and load balancing

3. **Conduit/Wire Pull Implications**:
   - **Issue**: Wire size change from unspecified to #4 wire for 70A circuit
   - **Action Required**: Verify existing conduit (if installed) can accommodate #4 wire
   - **Additional**: New #12 wire circuit for 120V receptacle requires separate home run or shared conduit

4. **Equipment Submittal Coordination**:
   - **Requirement**: "Refer to manufacturer's literature, wire and connect as required"
   - **Action Required**: Obtain and verify Hillphoenix CWC-8H cut sheets confirm power requirements
   - **Status**: Cut sheets referenced as attached (2 pages)

### Potential Conflicts

5. **Phase Imbalance**:
   - **Issue**: Removing 3-phase load and adding 1-phase loads may create panel phase imbalance
   - **Action Required**: Review Panel 'H' loading schedule to ensure balanced phases
   - **Note**: May require repositioning other loads

6. **Mounting Height Coordination**:
   - **Issue**: ISO receptacle mounting height not specified
   - **Action Required**: Coordinate with:
     - Equipment supplier for receptacle location requirements
     - Millwork contractor for countertop/cabinet clearances
     - Safeway operations for accessibility requirements

7. **Waterproof Receptacle Requirement**:
   - **Note**: Per general notes, all receptacles in preparation areas must be waterproof
   - **Verification Needed**: Confirm if 120V-1PH ISO outlet is in prep area requiring waterproof rating

8. **Construction Schedule Impact**:
   - **Note**: PCN states "No work is to be done before this matter is finalized and a Change Order is issued"
   - **Risk**: Potential delay if electrical rough-in already completed in this area
   - **Mitigation Required**: Verify construction status before finalizing change order

### Missing Information

9. **Cost Impact**:
   - PCN requires "signed letter with price including cost breakdown and change (if any) to construction schedule"
   - No cost information provided in this PCN package

10. **Exact Receptacle Location**:
    - "Separate circuit receptacle" location not dimensioned on plan
    - Must be coordinated with equipment layout and millwork

11. **Control Wiring**:
    - No mention of control wiring requirements for full-service vs self-service operation
    - May require additional low-voltage wiring coordination

## 6. Technical Analysis Summary

### Change Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Minor power modification with significant specification correction

**Complexity**: Medium
- Requires two separate circuits instead of one
- Voltage type change (3-phase to 1-phase) simplifies wiring but requires panel schedule revision
- Additional circuit adds complexity but is straightforward implementation

**Critical Path Impact**:
- Potential impact if electrical rough-in already in progress
- Requires change order approval before proceeding
- Schedule impact to be determined by contractor pricing submission

### Installation Sequence Recommendations

1. Verify Panel 'H' capacity and available breaker spaces
2. Confirm conduit routing can accommodate #4 wire
3. Install two separate home runs from Panel 'H' to equipment H-22 location
4. Coordinate exact receptacle location with equipment supplier and millwork
5. Install 70A-2P breaker and #4 wire for main case power
6. Install 15A-1P breaker and #12 wire for ISO receptacle
7. Verify waterproof receptacle requirements
8. Label circuits per general notes
9. Final verification with equipment specifications before connection

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk Items**:
- Equipment incompatibility if not corrected (MITIGATED by this PCN)
- Schedule delays if rough-in already complete

**Medium Risk Items**:
- Panel capacity constraints
- Phase balancing issues
- Coordination with multiple trades

**Low Risk Items**:
- Standard electrical installation once specifications confirmed
- Equipment is certified and code-compliant
