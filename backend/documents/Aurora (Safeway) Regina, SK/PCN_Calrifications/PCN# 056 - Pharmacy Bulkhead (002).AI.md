## Executive Summary

This Proposed Change Notice modifies the pharmacy bulkhead design to relocate the security shutter and millwork so they are not aligned with the structural bulkhead. The change includes modifications to the fixture plan, ceiling treatment, architectural layout, and structural elements. Key changes include providing a 3" gap between T-bar/ACT and bulkhead for security grille clearance, and deleting a steel angle at the south end of shutter for cost credit.

## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Critical Coordination Items

**1. Security Grille vs. Millwork Alignment**
- **Issue**: Original design had security shutter aligned with bulkhead
- **Resolution**: PCN modifies location so shutter/millwork are NOT in line with bulkhead
- **Impact**: Requires 3" setback from face of bulkhead GWB to centerline of security grille
- **Coordination Note**: "GC TO COORDINATE SECURITY GRILLE WITH PHARMACY FIXTURES/MILLWORK"

**2. Ceiling Clearance Gap**
- **Potential Conflict**: 3" gap required between T-Bar/ACT and bulkhead for security grille operation
- **Original Condition**: Appears ceiling may have been tight to bulkhead
- **Resolution**: Explicitly specify 3" gap in reflected ceiling plan
- **Verification Needed**: Confirm adequate clearance for grille operation and track mounting

**3. Structural Element Offset**
- **Issue**: 3"x3" HSS column centered on shutter is 1 1/2" off Grid Line 2
- **Impact**: Off-grid structural element requiring precise coordination
- **Affects**: Framing, millwork layout, and security grille alignment
- **Detail Required**: See detail callout showing column position relative to shutter track

**4. GWB-to-Shutter Interface**
- **Detail**: Gypsum wall board to butt up to shutter track (typical)
- **Coordination**: Requires precision to avoid gaps or interference
- **Trade Coordination**: Drywall contractor and security shutter installer

**5. Deleted Steel Angle**
- **Change**: Delete steel angle at south end of shutter (from PCN 2445-41)
- **Coordination Issue**: Ensure structural adequacy after deletion
- **Financial Impact**: Provide credit for deleted work
- **Verification**: Confirm no other supports required at south end

**6. Millwork-to-Glazing Interface**
- **Specification**: 16" high clear glazing on top of millwork cap by pharmacy millworker
- **Coordination**: GC to coordinate with pharmacy fixtures/millwork supplier
- **Trades Involved**: Millworker, glazing installer, security grille installer
- **Height Verification**: Total height 4'-9" to top of glazing

**7. Dimensional Discrepancies**
- **Steel vs. GWB**: 1" difference (329 3/4" steel-to-steel vs. 328 3/4" GWB-to-GWB)
- **Impact**: Normal accommodation for wall thickness but requires verification
- **Concern**: Ensure all openings (140A-140D) align properly with millwork

### Potential Issues Requiring Clarification

**8. Multiple Fixture Code References**
- **Observation**: Numerous A2, A2b, A3, A3b, C3 designations throughout plan
- **Concern**: Requires coordination with complete fixture plan set
- **Recommendation**: Cross-check all fixture locations with pharmacy equipment schedule

**9. Window Locations (W11, W12)**
- **Observation**: Windows noted near Room 141 and Room 142
- **Coordination**: Ensure windows don't interfere with millwork or security grille operation
- **Verify**: Window head heights relative to bulkhead elevation

**10. Room Subdivision Complexity**
- **Observation**: Multiple room subdivisions (140A-D, 141A-C)
- **Concern**: Complex framing coordination with varied opening widths
- **Impact**: Potential for misalignment if not carefully coordinated

## 11. Key Takeaways

1. **Primary Change**: Security shutter and millwork relocated to NOT be in line with bulkhead (3" setback)

2. **Critical Clearance**: 3" gap between T-bar/ACT and bulkhead required for security grille operation

3. **Structural Modification**: Delete steel angle at south end of shutter (credit item)

4. **Complex Coordination**: Multiple trades (GC, millworker, security installer, drywall, ceiling) require tight coordination

5. **Dimensional Precision**: Off-grid HSS column (1 1/2" offset) and multiple opening dimensions require careful verification

6. **Cost Impact**: One credit item (deleted steel angle) and several added items (trim, coordination, gap provision)

7. **Code Compliance**: Security, accessibility, fire-resistance, and structural requirements all require verification

8. **Product Specifications**: Axiom Classic trim, AMSTEL automated shutter, safety glazing - all require submittals

**Analysis Complete**: This PCN requires careful coordination between multiple trades and verification of dimensional accuracy, structural adequacy, and code compliance. The primary changes improve the security grille operation by offsetting it from the bulkhead and providing adequate ceiling clearance.
