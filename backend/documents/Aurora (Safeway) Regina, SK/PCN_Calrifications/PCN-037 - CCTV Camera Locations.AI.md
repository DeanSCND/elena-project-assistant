## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Conduit Credit Scope Change**:
   - **Issue**: PCN removes conduit requirement for data cabling in sales area for CCTV
   - **Concern**: Credit amount not specified in PCN; requires pricing from contractor
   - **Impact**: May affect schedule and other trades if conduit was already installed
   - **Coordination**: Requires owner approval and contractor cost breakdown

2. **Camera Location Finalization**:
   - **Issue**: Drawing Note F.3 states "The location and orientation of the CCTV cameras, switches, access control and other associated security devices are preliminary"
   - **Concern**: 54 camera locations shown but positions not final
   - **Impact**: Rough-in may require modifications; affects electrical contractor schedule
   - **Coordination**: Final locations must be confirmed before rough-in with security contractor and Sobeys representative

3. **System Pathway Separation**:
   - **Issue**: Drawing Note 4 requires "complete and separate pathway for each system (CCTV, Access Control, EAS, Security Gate, Security Alarm, Intrusion Detection, etc.)"
   - **Concern**: Potentially significant additional conduit runs not fully detailed on drawing
   - **Impact**: Increases conduit quantities and complexity beyond what's shown
   - **Coordination**: Electrical contractor to determine final conduit layout and sizing

4. **Power vs. Data Cabling Treatment**:
   - **Issue**: PCN specifies no conduit for data cabling in sales area, but power wiring requirements not clarified
   - **Concern**: Unclear if camera power uses conduit or alternate method
   - **Coordination**: Needs clarification from engineer and security contractor

5. **Fire Alarm Integration**:
   - **Issue**: Drawing Note 1 requires security gate interlock with fire alarm system
   - **Concern**: No fire alarm drawings referenced; coordination path unclear
   - **Impact**: Requires coordination with fire alarm contractor not mentioned in distribution
   - **Coordination**: May need separate coordination meeting

6. **Underground Duct Aftersets**:
   - **Issue**: Drawing Note 5 requires aftersets from U/F duct for CCTV power and signal
   - **Concern**: Underground duct locations not shown on this drawing
   - **Impact**: Requires coordination with civil/site drawings
   - **Cross-reference**: Need civil drawings showing U/F duct locations

7. **Vision Lane Camera Pathways**:
   - **Issue**: Drawing Note G.1 mentions "vision lane cameras" with undefined locations
   - **Concern**: These cameras not clearly identified on floor plan
   - **Impact**: Additional scope potentially not captured in camera count
   - **Coordination**: Confirm these are included in 54-camera total or additional

### Interface Issues

8. **Ceiling-Mounted Systems in Sales Area**:
   - **Concern**: No conduit in sales area ceiling for data, but structural ceiling support requirements not addressed
   - **Impact**: Camera mounting and cable management methodology unclear
   - **Coordination**: Confirm cable tray, J-hooks, or other support system

9. **Multi-Trade Coordination Points**:
   - Compressor Room security requires coordination with mechanical
   - Receiving door contacts require coordination with overhead door supplier
   - Checkout security wiring requires coordination with millwork/casework
   - Roof hatch door contact requires coordination with roofing contractor

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### General Code References

**Fire Safety**:
- Security gate system requires **interlock with fire alarm system** for automatic release in case of fire (Drawing Note 1)
- Complies with egress requirements for emergency release
- Requires coordination with fire alarm contractor and authority having jurisdiction

**Electrical Code Compliance**:
- All security wiring to be **run in conduit and concealed** (General Note 2)
- Exception: Surface mount conduit acceptable in:
  - Warehouse 191
  - Receiving 190
  - Compressor Room 300
- Minimum conduit size: 3/4" for security pathways
- Separate pathways required for each security system type
- Pull strings required in all security conduits

**Accessibility**:
- Universal Washroom 106 shown on plan
- Service desk and checkout areas appear to have adequate circulation space

**Security System Requirements**:
- All installation requires coordination with "Authority Having Jurisdiction" per PCN header
- Security system contractor coordination mandatory prior to rough-in
- Final device locations subject to Sobeys security representative approval

### Specific Code-Related Items

1. **Emergency Egress**:
   - Security gate automatic release requirement indicates life safety system integration
   - Multiple exit routes visible on plan (vestibule, stairs, outdoor seating area)

2. **Power Supply**:
   - 120V duplex receptacle required for security equipment panel
   - Appears to comply with standard power requirements for security systems

3. **Conduit Requirements**:
   - Concealed conduit requirement aligns with commercial building codes for finished spaces
   - Back-of-house areas allow surface mount (practical exemption for service areas)

4. **Room Access Control**:
   - Door contacts specified for:
     - Service roof access hatch (Drawing Note D.1)
     - Overhead doors (Drawing Note E.1)
   - Implies controlled access to restricted areas

5. **Data Room Requirements**:
   - IT Room 114 serves as CCTV equipment location
   - Requires adequate power, cooling, and access control (standard for IT/security equipment rooms)

### Compliance Concerns

1. **Preliminary Locations** (Drawing Note F.3):
   - May impact permit approvals if final locations differ significantly
   - AHJ coordination required before finalization

2. **Change Order Process**:
   - PCN header requires "Change Order" before work proceeds
   - Indicates formal approval process to maintain code compliance documentation

3. **Contractor Responsibility**:
   - General Note 1: Electrical contractor responsible for all pathways, controls, power wiring
   - Ensures single point of responsibility for code-compliant installation
