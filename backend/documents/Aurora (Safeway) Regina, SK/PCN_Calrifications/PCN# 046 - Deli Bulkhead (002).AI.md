## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Sprinkler Coordination:**
- Sprinkler pipe shown routing through bulkhead area
- **ISSUE**: Clearance between sprinkler and bulkhead framing needs verification
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Coordinate exact sprinkler pipe location with fire protection contractor
- **IMPACT**: May affect bulkhead depth or require sprinkler relocation

**2. Angle Brace Connection:**
- Angle brace shown at top of bulkhead
- **ISSUE**: Connection detail to structure above not specified
- **CONCERN**: Staff mezzanine floor structure may limit attachment points
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify structural attachment capacity and location

**3. Wall Tile vs. GWB:**
- Wall tile specified to be installed on face and underside
- **QUESTION**: Is wall tile applied directly to GWB or is GWB substrate beneath?
- **CLARIFICATION NEEDED**: Confirm whether GWB is finish substrate or if different backing required for tile
- **IMPACT**: Affects total bulkhead depth if tile adds thickness

**4. Ceiling Height Coordination:**
- Bulkhead at 9'-6" in Deli vs. 9'-0" ceiling in Offices
- **OBSERVATION**: 6" step in ceiling height across wall
- **VERIFY**: Transition detail where bulkhead meets wall between Deli and Offices

**5. Acoustic Ceiling Tile (ACT) Coordination:**
- U/S ACT elevation at 110'-6"
- **ISSUE**: Relationship between ACT grid and bulkhead not detailed
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify ACT grid termination at bulkhead

**6. Clearance Above Bulkhead:**
- Only 6" clearance shown between top of bulkhead and structure
- **CONCERN**: May be tight for HVAC, electrical conduits, or other services
- **VERIFY**: Coordinate with MEP drawings to ensure adequate clearance

### Missing Information

1. **Steel Stud Spacing**: Not specified (typically 16" or 24" O.C.)
2. **Stud Gauge**: Not specified (typically 20ga or 25ga)
3. **Track Sizes**: Top and bottom track specifications not provided
4. **Wall Tile Type**: Specific tile type, size, and installation method not detailed
5. **Fastener Specifications**: Connection hardware not specified
6. **Fire Rating**: No fire rating requirement mentioned
7. **Insulation**: No mention of acoustic or thermal insulation within bulkhead
8. **Access Panels**: No access panels shown for future MEP service access

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Building Code Considerations

**1. Fire Resistance:**
- **OBSERVATION**: No fire rating specified for bulkhead assembly
- **CONSIDERATION**: If separating different occupancy types or fire areas, may require rated assembly
- **ACTION**: Verify if bulkhead is part of fire separation or smoke barrier
- **REFERENCE**: NBC Part 3 - Fire Separation requirements

**2. Fire Protection:**
- **OBSERVATION**: Sprinkler shown in area
- **COMPLIANCE**: Sprinkler coverage must be maintained per NFPA 13
- **VERIFY**: Sprinkler head placement relative to bulkhead
- **CONSIDERATION**: Bulkhead may create obstruction requiring additional sprinkler heads

**3. Accessibility:**
- **OBSERVATION**: 9'-6" clearance in Deli
- **COMPLIANCE**: Adequate headroom for accessible route
- **REFERENCE**: NBC 3.8 - Barrier-Free Design (minimum 6'-8" clearance required)
- **STATUS**: Compliant (9'-6" > 6'-8")

**4. Food Service Requirements:**
- **OBSERVATION**: Wall tile specified in Deli area
- **COMPLIANCE**: Smooth, cleanable surfaces required in food preparation areas
- **REFERENCE**: Food Premises Regulations, Saskatchewan Health Authority
- **CONSIDERATION**: Tile must be moisture-resistant, non-porous, and easily cleanable
- **STATUS**: Wall tile appropriate for Deli environment if properly installed

**5. Ceiling Height:**
- **OBSERVATION**: 9'-6" ceiling height in Deli
- **COMPLIANCE**: Adequate for retail food service
- **REFERENCE**: NBC minimum habitable room height typically 7'-6" to 8'-0"
- **STATUS**: Compliant

**6. Structural:**
- **OBSERVATION**: Bulkhead suspended from mezzanine structure
- **COMPLIANCE**: Dead load must be accounted for in structural design
- **ACTION**: Verify structural capacity for bulkhead load
- **REFERENCE**: NBC Part 4 - Structural Design

**7. Ventilation:**
- **OBSERVATION**: Bulkhead may affect air distribution
- **COMPLIANCE**: Deli requires adequate ventilation per NBC Part 6
- **ACTION**: Verify HVAC design accounts for bulkhead obstruction

### Health & Safety Code Items

**1. Food Safety:**
- Cleanable, non-absorbent finishes required (wall tile meets this)
- No unsealed penetrations that could harbor pests or bacteria

**2. Sanitation:**
- Access for cleaning both face and underside of bulkhead
- Consider removable panels if MEP access needed

**3. Material Selection:**
- Food-grade materials where applicable
- Moisture-resistant gypsum board recommended in food preparation areas

2. Install top track to structure (coordinate with structural attachment)
3. Install angle bracing
4. Install steel studs at specified spacing
5. Install 1/2" GWB to face and underside
6. Coordinate sprinkler rough-in/relocation if required
7. Install wall tile finish to face and underside
8. Coordinate with ceiling contractor for ACT termination

### Coordination Requirements

- **Electrical**: Verify conduit routing and clearances
- **Fire Protection**: Coordinate sprinkler pipe location and head placement
- **Structural**: Verify attachment to staff mezzanine structure
- **Ceiling**: Coordinate ACT grid termination
- **Wall Tile Installer**: Confirm substrate requirements and transition details

### Quality Assurance
- Verify plumb and level of framing
- Confirm clearance to all MEP systems
- Verify wall tile installation per manufacturer's specifications
- Inspect angle brace connections for structural adequacy
- Confirm fire-stopping at all penetrations (if rated assembly)

## 9. QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

1. **Steel Stud Specifications**: Confirm gauge and spacing (16" O.C. or 24" O.C.)?
2. **Wall Tile Details**: Specific tile type, size, and grout requirements?
3. **Fire Rating**: Is this bulkhead required to have a fire rating?
4. **Insulation**: Is acoustic or thermal insulation required within bulkhead cavity?
5. **Access Panels**: Are access panels required for future MEP service?
6. **Sprinkler Coordination**: Has sprinkler pipe location been finalized?
7. **GWB Type**: Should moisture-resistant (MR) or regular GWB be used in Deli environment?
8. **Structural Attachment**: What is the approved method for attaching to mezzanine structure?
9. **ACT Termination**: How does ACT grid terminate at bulkhead?
10. **Transition Details**: How does bulkhead transition at wall between Deli and Offices?

## 10. RISK ASSESSMENT

**Low Risk:**
- Standard steel stud framing construction
- Clear dimensional requirements
- Straightforward wall tile application

**Medium Risk:**
- Sprinkler coordination (requires MEP coordination)
- Structural attachment to mezzanine (requires engineering verification)
- Wall tile substrate preparation

**High Risk:**
- Inadequate clearance above bulkhead for unforeseen MEP systems
- Sprinkler relocation if current routing conflicts with bulkhead
- Structural capacity issues if mezzanine not designed for additional load

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-construction coordination meeting with all trades
- Field verification of existing conditions before fabrication
- Mock-up or sample section for wall tile installation approval
- Structural engineer to verify attachment details
