## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Issues

#### Dimensional Verification Required
- **Critical Note**: Document explicitly states "Site confirm dimensions"
- **Risk**: Glass shelves are custom-cut and cannot be easily modified after fabrication
- **Recommendation**: Field verify exact wall dimensions, stud locations, and clearances before ordering glass
- **Coordination**: Ensure electrical/mechanical penetrations in wall are identified before drilling for standards

#### Installation Sequence
- **Concern**: Wall finishes must be complete before shelf standard installation
- **Coordination**: Verify drywall, paint, and tile work (if any) is complete
- **Issue**: No specification of wall substrate type or mounting method
- **Recommendation**: Confirm wall backing/blocking is adequate for load-bearing shelving system

#### Load Capacity
- **Gap**: No specified load capacity for shelves or maximum weight limits
- **Risk**: Heavy floral displays or supplies may overload glass shelves
- **Recommendation**: Verify Richelieu hardware is rated for intended loads; typical 1/4" tempered glass at 24"x12" supports 15-25 lbs when properly supported

#### Clearance Issues
- **Helium Mill**: Shown at 36" height - verify no conflict with shelf placement
- **Counter depth**: Ensure adequate clearance between counter edge and wall-mounted shelves
- **Overhead clearances**: Verify no conflicts with ceiling-mounted equipment, lighting, or HVAC

#### Product Availability
- **Concern**: Specific Richelieu product numbers must be available
- **Risk**: Product discontinuation or long lead times
- **Recommendation**: Verify stock availability before proceeding; identify acceptable alternates if needed

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Glass Safety Requirements

#### Tempered Glass Specification
- **Compliant**: Specification calls for "Heavy Duty Tempered Glass"
- **Code Reference**: IBC 2406 - Safety glazing required for shelving in retail areas
- **Standard**: Must meet ANSI Z97.1 or CPSC 16 CFR 1201 for safety glazing
- **Verification**: Confirm glass supplier provides certification of tempered glass meeting safety standards

#### Edge Treatment
- **Requirement**: Tempered glass edges should be polished or seamed to prevent sharp edges
- **Code**: OSHA requirements for workplace safety
- **Recommendation**: Specify "polished edges" or "seamed edges" with glass order

### Structural Requirements

#### Wall Mounting
- **Load-Bearing**: Wall must support dynamic loads from shelving system
- **Anchoring**: Must anchor to wall studs or blocking, not just drywall
- **Spacing**: Verify standard spacing matches stud spacing (typically 16" or 24" O.C.)
- **Code**: IBC 1604.8.1 - Shelving must be designed for intended loads with safety factor

#### Retail Safety
- **Application**: Food retail environment (grocery store)
- **Consideration**: Public access area requires secure installation to prevent shelf collapse
- **Recommendation**: Use all manufacturer-recommended fasteners and follow installation instructions

### Accessibility

#### Reach Ranges
- **ADA Compliance**: If shelves are for customer access, verify compliance with reach range requirements
- **Forward Reach**: Maximum 48" above floor (ADA 308.2.1)
- **Side Reach**: Maximum 54" over obstruction ≤20" deep (ADA 308.3.2)
- **Note**: If display-only (employee access), ADA may not apply

### Fire/Life Safety

#### Non-Combustible Materials
- **Glass**: Non-combustible material - compliant
- **Hardware**: Metal standards and brackets - compliant
- **Location**: Verify no conflict with egress paths or fire-rated assemblies

### Health Department (Food Safety)

#### Cleanability
- **Material**: Glass and white powder-coated metal are cleanable and non-porous
- **Compliance**: Suitable for food retail environment
- **Maintenance**: Must be cleanable per health department standards for food retail

#### Sanitation
- **Configuration**: Open shelving design allows for easy cleaning
- **Concern**: Verify local health department approval for open glass shelving in floral prep area
- **Recommendation**: Confirm this application complies with Saskatchewan Health Authority requirements

## 7. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIELD VERIFICATION

### Pre-Installation Checklist
1. **Wall dimensions**: Measure exact width of floral wall area for shelf placement
2. **Stud locations**: Mark all stud locations for standard mounting
3. **Wall substrate**: Verify wall construction (wood studs, metal studs, concrete block)
4. **Blocking**: Confirm adequate backing exists or install blocking as needed
5. **Clearances**: Verify no conflicts with helium mill, electrical outlets, or other wall-mounted equipment
6. **Level/plumb**: Check wall is plumb and level for proper shelf installation
7. **Finishes**: Confirm all paint and finishes are complete before drilling
8. **Quantity**: Count and confirm number of shelf standards, brackets, and glass shelves needed

### Documentation Required
1. Shop drawings showing exact shelf layout and spacing
2. Product submittals for Richelieu hardware
3. Glass fabrication drawings with edge detail
4. Tempered glass certification from supplier
5. Load capacity certification for shelf system
6. Installation instructions from manufacturer

## 8. SUMMARY

This PCN authorizes the addition of a white-finished, adjustable glass shelving system to the Floral Prep Area back wall. The system uses high-quality Richelieu slotted standards and brackets with 1/4" tempered glass shelves measuring 24"W x 12"D. The design provides flexible, cleanable display shelving appropriate for a retail food environment.

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Site verification of dimensions before glass fabrication
- Proper wall backing/blocking for secure installation
- Tempered glass certification for safety compliance
- White finish hardware for clean aesthetic
- Coordination with helium mill and other wall-mounted equipment

**Status**: Awaiting contractor pricing and schedule impact assessment per PCN process.
