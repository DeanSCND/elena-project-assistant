## Executive Summary

This PCN addresses a field discrepancy between the installed electrical infrastructure and actual equipment requirements for the Olive Bar unit in the Deli area. The as-built equipment requires 208V single-phase power at 25A, whereas the original design specified two 120V circuits at 20A each.

**Critical Change**: Upgrade from (2) 20A-1P circuits to (1) 25A-2P circuit with corresponding wire size increase from #12 to #10 AWG.

## 4. Identified Conflicts & Issues

### Primary Conflict - Equipment Mismatch
**Issue**: Field-delivered Olive Bar equipment does not match electrical design specifications.

**Original Design**:
- (2) 120V-1PH circuits
- (2) 20A-1P breakers
- (2) Duplex receptacles
- #12 AWG wire

**Actual Equipment Requirements** (per nameplate):
- 208V single-phase
- 25A-2P breaker required
- Direct hardwired connection
- #10 AWG wire minimum

**Impact**:
- Existing breakers undersized (20A vs 25A required)
- Wrong voltage (120V vs 208V)
- Wrong connection type (receptacles vs direct connection)
- Wire gauge insufficient (#12 vs #10 required)

### Drawing Discrepancy
**Issue**: Text in PCN letter references "E2.4 - Partial Layout - Power" but actual drawing is numbered "E2.1"

**Resolution**: Confirmed drawing E2.1 is the correct partial power layout drawing.

### Installation Status
**Per RFI**: Incorrect breakers and wiring already installed on site prior to equipment arrival and nameplate verification.

**Contractor Impact**: Requires rework to:
1. Replace two single-pole breakers with one 2-pole breaker in Panel 'D'
2. Remove existing #12 wire and install #10 wire
3. Remove duplex receptacles
4. Install direct connection junction box
5. Verify equipment nameplate requirements on-site

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### NEC/CEC Compliance Requirements

#### Wire Sizing - CEC Rule 8-104
- **MCA**: 16.5A minimum circuit ampacity
- **Required Wire**: #10 AWG copper minimum (30A rated in 75°C column)
- **Specified**: #10 AWG - COMPLIANT
- **Note**: #12 AWG (20A rated) would be insufficient for 16.5A MCA with continuous load factors

#### Breaker Sizing - CEC Rule 8-106
- **MCA**: 16.5A
- **Maximum OCPD**: Typically 25A per manufacturer specifications
- **Specified**: 25A-2P breaker - COMPLIANT
- **Previous**: 20A inadequate for equipment protection

#### Connection Method - CEC Rule 26-700
- **Equipment Type**: Commercial refrigeration
- **Required**: Direct connection (hardwired) per manufacturer
- **Specified**: Direct connection junction box - COMPLIANT
- **Previous**: Cord-and-plug via receptacles - NON-COMPLIANT for this equipment

#### Voltage Requirements
- **Equipment Rated**: 120/208V (dual voltage capability)
- **Operating Voltage**: 208V-1PH for this application
- **Available**: Panel 'D' is 120/208V-3PH-4W system - COMPLIANT
- **Connection**: Line-to-line for 208V (between two phases)

#### Panel Loading
- **Panel 'D'**: 100A main
- **Olive Bar Load**: 25A (25% of panel capacity)
- **Code Requirement**: Panel loading should not exceed 80% continuous load
- **Note**: Panel schedule review required to ensure total load compliance

### General Notes from Drawing

1. **Verification Required**: "ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR TO CONFIRM ALL EQUIPMENT LOADS, CIRCUIT SIZES, AND MOUNTING HEIGHTS PRIOR TO ROUGH-IN"
   - This note was critical and the conflict validates its importance

2. **Nameplate Priority**: "PROVIDE WIRING AND CIRCUIT BREAKERS TO FINAL NAMEPLATE OF THE EQUIPMENT"
   - Equipment nameplate takes precedence over preliminary schedules

3. **Coordination**: "COORDINATE FINAL LOCATION AND POWER / CONTROL REQUIREMENTS OF ALL EQUIPMENT IN VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS"
   - Required coordination between electrical contractor, equipment suppliers, and trades

4. **Labeling**: "PROVIDE PERMANENT TYPE WRITTEN LABEL ON ALL RECEPTACLES IDENTIFYING THE CIRCUIT NUMBER AND PANEL BOARD NAME"
   - Applies to all receptacle circuits (not applicable to direct-connected Olive Bar)

5. **Neutral Wire**: "PROVIDE A NEUTRAL WIRE FOR ALL EQUIPMENT"
   - Ensures 4-wire connection capability where required

## 6. Technical Analysis

### Load Calculation Verification

**Nameplate Data**:
- Voltage: 120/208V
- Refrigeration FLA: 3A
- Defrost FLA: 10A
- FLC: 16.9A (combined full load current)

**Circuit Ampacity Check**:
- FLC: 16.9A
- MCA = FLC × 1.25 (continuous load factor) = 16.9 × 1.25 = 21.125A
- This explains the specified MCA of 16.5A with 25A breaker requirement
- #10 AWG rated 30A at 75°C provides adequate margin

**Breaker Sizing**:
- 25A breaker allows for inrush current and compressor starting
- Provides proper protection without nuisance tripping
- Meets manufacturer's maximum OCPD specification

### Installation Considerations

1. **Junction Box Sizing**: Must accommodate #10 conductors and equipment whip connections
2. **Accessibility**: Junction box must remain accessible per CEC requirements
3. **Equipment Whip**: Verify manufacturer-provided whip length and connection method
4. **Grounding**: Ensure proper equipment grounding conductor sized per CEC Table 16
5. **Labeling**: Label junction box with circuit identification and panel source

### Coordination Items

- **Mechanical**: Confirm Olive Bar final location with refrigeration contractor
- **Architectural**: Verify no conflicts with millwork or finishes at junction box location
- **Structural**: Confirm mounting surface for junction box
- **Schedule Impact**: Rework may affect completion timeline (per PCN note)

## 7. Cost & Schedule Implications

### Change Order Requirements
- PCN cover states: "No work is to be done before this matter is finalized and a 'Change Order' is issued"
- Contractor to submit: Signed letter with price breakdown and schedule impact

### Scope of Rework
1. Remove existing two 20A-1P breakers from Panel 'D'
2. Install one 25A-2P breaker in Panel 'D' circuits 13-14
3. Remove existing #12 AWG wire run
4. Install new #10 AWG wire run (3-wire + ground for 208V-1PH)
5. Remove two duplex receptacles
6. Install direct connection junction box per code
7. Label and test new circuit

### Potential Claims
- Extra labor for demolition and reinstallation
- Material waste (wire, breakers, receptacles)
- Schedule delay if on critical path
- Coordination costs with other trades

## 8. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Issue Change Order**: Formalize pricing and schedule impact
2. **Verify All Equipment**: Check all other food service equipment nameplates against drawings before rough-in
3. **Update Master Specifications**: Ensure equipment cut sheets reviewed during procurement
4. **Panel Load Analysis**: Verify Panel 'D' has adequate capacity for revised load

### Quality Control Measures
1. Implement nameplate verification checklist for all equipment
2. Hold pre-installation coordination meeting with equipment suppliers
3. Require submittal approval before ordering electrical materials
4. Photo-document all equipment nameplates upon delivery

### Drawing Updates Required
1. **E0.2**: Panel 'D' schedule - COMPLETED (shows 25A-2P, #10, Olive Bar)
2. **E2.1**: Equipment schedule table - COMPLETED (shows D-22 with correct specs)
3. **E2.1**: Floor plan symbols - Update to show junction box instead of receptacles
4. **As-Built**: Ensure final as-builts reflect installed condition

### Lessons Learned
1. **Early Equipment Verification**: Obtain and verify equipment specifications during design phase
2. **Submittal Process**: Require electrical cut sheets with all equipment submittals
3. **Pre-Purchase Coordination**: Coordinate with owner's equipment purchasing before finalizing designs
4. **Allowance Planning**: Consider electrical allowances for owner-furnished equipment with TBD specifications

## 10. Summary

This PCN successfully resolves a critical equipment-to-design mismatch for the Olive Bar electrical service. The revision upgrades the circuit from dual 120V receptacle circuits to a single 208V direct-connected circuit with appropriate wire sizing and overcurrent protection. The issue was identified through proper field verification (RFI #79) before equipment connection, preventing potential equipment damage or code violations.

**Key Takeaway**: This change emphasizes the critical importance of early equipment verification and the hierarchy of design documents - actual equipment nameplates take precedence over preliminary design schedules when conflicts arise.

**Status**: PCN issued and pending Change Order execution. Installation may proceed once formalized and approved.
