## 4. Identified Conflicts and Coordination Issues

### Electrical Conflicts

**1. Receptacle Type Mismatch - RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Original design specified NEMA 5-15R receptacles (120V) for checkout coolers
- **Conflict**: RDEL-22 equipment requires 208V single-phase power, not 120V
- **Resolution**: Replace three (3) NEMA 5-15R with NEMA 6-15R (208V) receptacles
- **Impact**: Requires different rough-in wiring (2 hots + ground vs. 1 hot + neutral + ground)

**2. Panel Schedule Capacity**
- **Issue**: Adding three 15A-2P breakers to Panel 2C requires available panel space
- **Resolution**: Convert three existing 15A-1P breakers to spare status to accommodate new loads
- **Verification Needed**: Confirm Panel 2C has physical space for 2-pole breakers and that panel ampacity is sufficient for added load
- **Load Calculation**: Maximum additional load = 3 × 6.55A = 19.65A (worst case with 1400mm modules)

**3. Circuit Numbering Ambiguity**
- **Observation**: Circuit 29/30 appears to change from "SPARE" to "CHECKOUT COOLER"
- **Clarification Needed**: Verify whether circuits 25/26 and 27/28 (formerly "SERVICE DESK") are being repurposed or if these are different circuits
- **Impact**: May affect service desk power requirements if circuits are being reassigned

**4. Walkerduct Coordination**
- **Issue**: Existing walkerduct system sized for previous equipment
- **Note**: Drawing detail shows 2×(#2 ducts) and 1×(#4 duct) for checkout power feeds

### Low Risk Items

**7. Receptacle Replacement**
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Concern**: Simple swap of receptacle types
- **Mitigation**: Straightforward electrical modification, low complexity

**8. Panel Circuit Modifications**
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Concern**: Adding breakers to existing panel
- **Mitigation**: Standard electrical work, assuming panel has capacity

- Size and article numbers to be confirmed

**Installation Costs:**
- Delivery and rigging to checkout area
- Placement and positioning in checkout counters
- Factory startup and commissioning (if required)
- Refrigerant leak testing and certification

### Architectural/Millwork Costs

**Potential Costs:**

- Finish coordination (black coolers vs. counter finish)
- Field adjustments for dimensional coordination

### Schedule-Related Costs

**Potential Impacts:**
- Delay costs if equipment delivery late
- Acceleration costs to maintain project schedule
- Coordination costs for late PCN implementation
