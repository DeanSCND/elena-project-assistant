## 8. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Load Analysis

**TV Power Consumption**:
- **Circuit Capacity**: 15A @ 120V = 1,800VA
- **Assumed TV Size**: Typical commercial display 40"-55"
- **Estimated Consumption**: 150-300 watts
- **Diversity Factor**: Single dedicated load
- **Assessment**: 15A circuit is adequately sized for typical commercial TV
- **Note**: Verify actual equipment load does not exceed circuit capacity

**Panel C2 Impact**:
- **Circuit Addition**: One 15A circuit (1,800VA)
- **Panel Rating**: 200A @ 208V = 41,600VA (3-phase)
- **Load Impact**: Approximately 4.3% of panel capacity (single phase)
- **Assessment**: Minimal impact on panel capacity
- **Recommendation**: Verify phase balancing maintained within acceptable limits

### Voltage Drop Considerations

**Estimated Circuit Length**:
- **Panel Location**: Office Corridor (back-of-house)
- **Load Location**: Vestibule 100 (front entrance)
- **Estimated Distance**: 50-100 feet (15-30 meters) - requires field verification
- **Conductor Size**: #14 AWG copper (minimum for 15A circuit)

**Voltage Drop Calculation** (worst case - 100 ft):
- **Formula**: VD = 2 × K × I × L / CM
- **K** (copper): 12.9 ohms per CMil-foot
- **Current**: 3A (assumed TV load)
- **Length**: 100 feet one-way
- **CM**: 4,110 (for #14 AWG)
- **VD**: 2 × 12.9 × 3 × 100 / 4,110 = 1.88V
- **Percentage**: 1.88V / 120V = 1.57%
- **CEC Limit**: 3% for branch circuits
- **Assessment**: #14 AWG acceptable for distances up to 100 feet
- **Note**: Verify actual distance; upsize to #12 AWG if approaching limits

### Data Infrastructure Analysis

**Network Requirements**:
- **Application**: TV display (likely networked for content management)
- **Bandwidth**: Depends on content type (static, video streaming, etc.)
- **Cable Category**: CAT6 recommended minimum for commercial applications
- **Distance Limitation**: 100m (328 feet) maximum for CAT6
- **Assessment**: Standard CAT6 installation should be adequate

**Data Routing Considerations**:
- **Source**: Likely from main data rack (location TBD from E5.0)
- **Path**: Similar to power circuit routing
- **Separation**: Maintain from power circuits per code
- **Installation**: Dedicated conduit or cable tray recommended

### Installation Methodology

**Rough-In Sequence**:
1. Verify mounting height with all stakeholders
2. Mark outlet locations on wall
3. Verify no conflicts with TV mounting bracket
4. Install outlet boxes at specified height
5. Route power circuit from Panel C2
6. Route data cable from data rack
7. Install fire stopping at penetrations
8. Verify rough-in inspection
9. Coordinate finish work with wall installation
10. Install devices after wall finishing complete
11. Test and commission

**Coordination Checkpoints**:
- Pre-rough-in: Verify heights and locations
- During rough-in: Verify routing and separations
- Pre-drywall: Verify box locations and fire stopping
- Post-drywall: Verify device installation and testing

---

## 9. COST IMPLICATIONS (INFORMATIONAL)

This PCN will result in additional costs for:
- Panel breaker and circuit installation
- Conduit and wire from panel to vestibule
- Receptacle and outlet box installation
- Data cable and outlet installation
- Fire stopping materials
- Coordination time
- Testing and commissioning

Note: Contractor to provide pricing per PCN requirements.

---

## 10. SCHEDULE IMPACT

**Critical Path Items**:
1. Height coordination approval - REQUIRED before rough-in
2. TV equipment specifications - REQUIRED for final positioning
3. Rough-in installation - Coordinate with wall framing/installation
4. Fire stopping - Before drywall/finish installation
5. Device installation - After wall finishing
6. Testing - Before TV installation
7. TV installation and commissioning - After all electrical/data complete

**Potential Delays**:
- Awaiting décor/architectural coordination for heights
- TV equipment lead time
- Coordination with other trades in vestibule area

---

## 11. CONCLUSION

PCN# 030 is a straightforward addition of power and data for a vestibule TV display. The scope is clear, but successful implementation depends on critical coordination items, particularly the mounting height specification. The electrical circuit appears adequately sized and the panel has capacity for the addition. The 2" separation between power and data should be verified as adequate, though it is minimal by industry standards.

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. Obtain TV mounting height specification before rough-in
2. Verify TV equipment specifications for load and connectivity
3. Maintain proper separation between power and data
4. Coordinate with all stakeholders (electrical, data, décor, architectural)
5. Comply with all applicable codes and standards

**Recommendation**: Issue RFI for mounting heights and TV specifications immediately to prevent delays to rough-in activities.
