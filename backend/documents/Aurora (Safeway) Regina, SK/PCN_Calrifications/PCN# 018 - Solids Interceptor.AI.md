## 3. CHANGE DESCRIPTION

**What is being changed:**
The solid interceptor manufacturer/model selection is being revised.

**Original Specification:**
Not explicitly stated in the PCN (would be shown on original M1.1 and M4.1 drawings)

**Revised Specification:**
Solid interceptors to be Endura models (or equal) appropriately selected for the required storage capacity.

**Reason for Change:**
Not explicitly stated in the PCN. Likely due to:
- Product availability
- Cost considerations
- Performance specifications
- Manufacturer preference/availability in Regina, SK market

**Scope of Impact:**
- Affects plumbing foundation plan and pits (Drawing M1.1)
- Affects mechanical schedules (Drawing M4.1)
- May impact procurement timeline and pricing

## 4. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Equipment/Materials Affected:**
- Solid interceptors (grease/solids separation equipment)

**Manufacturer:**
- Endura models or approved equal

**Selection Criteria:**
- Must be appropriately selected for required storage capacity
- Implies multiple units may be involved, each sized for specific application

**Model Numbers/Selections:**
Not specified in PCN - to be determined based on storage capacity requirements shown in referenced drawings

**Referenced Drawings:**
- **M1.1** – Foundation Plan Plumbing and Pits
- **M4.1** – Mechanical Schedules

**Dimensions, Capacities, Ratings:**
Not specified in PCN - must reference manufacturer's specifications for Endura models based on storage capacity requirements

## 5. CROSS-REFERENCES

**Related Drawings:**
- Mechanical Drawing M1.1 – Foundation Plan Plumbing and Pits (shows physical location and pit sizing)
- Mechanical Drawing M4.1 – Mechanical Schedules (shows equipment schedules and specifications)

**Other PCNs Referenced:**
None directly referenced

**Systems/Disciplines Affected:**
- **Mechanical (Primary):** Plumbing system, waste water treatment
- **Structural:** Foundation pits may require sizing adjustments
- **Civil:** Site drainage and waste water management
- **Architectural:** Potential coordination with floor plans if pit sizes change

## 6. COORDINATION NOTES

**Trades Involved:**
1. **Plumbing Contractor:** Primary installer of solid interceptors
2. **General Contractor:** Coordination of installation sequence
3. **Structural/Concrete:** May need to verify pit dimensions for Endura models
4. **Mechanical Engineer (CGM):** Verification of capacity calculations

**Potential Conflicts with Other Work:**
- Foundation/pit work must be coordinated before slab pour
- Verify Endura model dimensions match existing pit designs on M1.1
- Ensure new equipment capacity meets health code requirements for food service operations
- Coordinate with kitchen equipment layout (commercial kitchen waste typically requires grease/solids separation)

**Sequence Dependencies:**
1. Verify Endura model selection meets capacity requirements
2. Confirm pit dimensions on M1.1 accommodate selected Endura models
3. Update M4.1 schedule with Endura model numbers and specifications
4. Procure equipment
5. Install pits/foundation work
6. Install interceptors
7. Connect to plumbing system
8. Commission and test

**Critical Coordination Points:**
- Health authority approval (may be required for grease interceptor changes)
- Saskatchewan plumbing code compliance
- City of Regina approval if required for waste water treatment equipment changes
- Verify Endura models are acceptable "or equal" to original specification

## 7. COST/SCHEDULE IMPACT

**Cost Impact:**
Not specified in PCN. Contractor (Quorex Construction Services Ltd.) required to submit signed letter with:
- Price including cost breakdown
- Any change to construction schedule

**Schedule Impact:**
Not specified in PCN. To be determined by contractor based on:
- Endura model availability
- Lead time differences vs. original specification
- Any required re-engineering or pit modifications

**Notes:**
- Standard PCN states "No work is to be done before this matter is finalized and a 'Change Order' is issued"
- Authority having jurisdiction must advise of any objections
- This appears to be a product substitution that should have minimal schedule impact if dimensions are compatible

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Food Service Context:**
Solid interceptors (also called grease interceptors or grease traps) are critical equipment in commercial food service operations like the Aurora Food Store. They:
- Separate fats, oils, and grease (FOG) from wastewater
- Prevent FOG from entering municipal sewer systems
- Are typically required by health codes and municipal bylaws
- Require regular maintenance and cleaning

**Endura Brand:**
Endura is a recognized manufacturer of grease interceptors and related products for commercial food service applications. The "or equal" clause allows contractor flexibility if Endura models are unavailable or uncompetitive.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW RISK** if Endura models have same or similar dimensions as original specification
- **MEDIUM RISK** if pit dimensions require modification
- **COMPLIANCE RISK** if health authority or municipality requires specific approval for equipment change

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify Endura model dimensions against M1.1 pit dimensions
2. Confirm capacity calculations meet food service requirements
3. Obtain health authority approval if required
4. Update equipment submittal documentation
5. Verify maintenance access requirements are met
