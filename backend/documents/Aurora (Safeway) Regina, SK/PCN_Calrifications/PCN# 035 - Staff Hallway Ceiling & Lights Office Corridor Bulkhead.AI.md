## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

1. **Ceiling Height Discrepancy**
   - Plan shows "GWB +/-8'-11""
   - Detail shows "NEW BULKHEAD @ 8'-6" A.F.F."
   - **Issue**: 5" difference between notations - clarify which is correct dimension
   - **Impact**: Affects coordination with lighting, HVAC, and door head heights

2. **Lighting Coordination**
   - Two LA fixtures being changed to F1 type
   - **Issue**: Ensure F1 fixtures are compatible with 8'-6" bulkhead height
   - **Question**: Will bulkhead construction affect fixture mounting or light distribution?

3. **Ceiling Transition**
   - ACT-1 at 9'-0" in staff hallway
   - GWB bulkhead at 8'-6" in office corridor
   - **Issue**: Detail required for transition between ACT and bulkhead (not shown)
   - **Question**: How does 6" drop resolve visually and structurally?

4. **HVAC/Mechanical Coordination**
   - No mechanical changes noted in this PCN
   - **Issue**: Verify that bulkhead does not conflict with existing ductwork, diffusers, or sprinkler heads
   - **Action Required**: Coordinate with mechanical drawings

5. **Fire Protection**
   - Bulkhead creates a ceiling plane change
   - **Issue**: Verify sprinkler coverage is adequate with new bulkhead configuration
   - **Action Required**: Coordinate with fire protection engineer

### Questions Requiring Clarification

1. Is the correct bulkhead height 8'-6" or 8'-11"?
2. What is the construction detail for the bulkhead (framing, GWB layers, finish)?
3. Are there any HVAC changes required due to the new bulkhead?
4. What is the exact product specification for "GAYLTON CAROL"?
5. Do door head heights in the corridor remain compliant with the lowered bulkhead?

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Accessibility (Barrier-Free Design)

1. **Ceiling Height in Corridors**
   - Minimum clear height: Typically 80" (6'-8") required for accessible routes
   - **Status**: 8'-6" (102") bulkhead exceeds minimum ✓
   - **Concern**: Verify no protruding fixtures or elements below 80" into the accessible route

2. **Barrier-Free Washroom (BF W/M)**
   - Adjacent to bulkhead location
   - **Status**: No apparent conflict with accessibility requirements

### Building Code - General

1. **Corridor Width**
   - Bulkhead must not reduce corridor width below minimum required
   - **Action Required**: Verify corridor maintains required width (typically 44" minimum for egress corridors)

2. **Ceiling Heights**
   - Minimum habitable room ceiling height: Typically 7'-6" (90")
   - Corridor minimum: Typically 7'-0" to 7'-6" depending on jurisdiction
   - **Status**: 8'-6" bulkhead exceeds minimums ✓

3. **Fire Separation**
   - Bulkhead construction in corridor serving multiple rooms
   - **Action Required**: Verify GWB construction meets fire resistance rating requirements for corridor assembly
   - **Question**: Is fire-rated GWB required? What rating?

### Electrical Code

1. **Lighting Levels**
   - Corridor lighting must meet minimum illumination requirements
   - **Action Required**: Verify F1 fixtures provide adequate light levels per code (typically 50 lux minimum for corridors)
   - **Concern**: Lower bulkhead may affect light distribution

2. **Fixture Clearances**
   - F1 fixtures must maintain required clearances from combustible materials
   - **Status**: To be verified with fixture cut sheets

### Mechanical/Fire Protection

1. **Sprinkler Coverage**
   - Bulkhead creates a "pocket" that may require additional sprinkler heads
   - **Action Required**: Coordinate with fire protection contractor
   - **Code Reference**: NFPA 13 or applicable local code for sprinkler spacing

2. **Smoke Detection**
   - Verify smoke detector coverage is not compromised by bulkhead
   - **Action Required**: Review fire alarm drawings

## 10. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. Issue RFI for ceiling height clarification (8'-6" vs 8'-11")
2. Request bulkhead construction detail from architect
3. Obtain F1 fixture cut sheets and photometric data
4. Coordinate with mechanical engineer for clearance verification
5. Schedule coordination meeting with all trades affected
6. Verify "GAYLTON CAROL" product availability and lead time
7. Prepare cost estimate per PCN requirements
8. Review impact on construction schedule
