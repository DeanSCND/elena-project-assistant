---

## 5. Identified Conflicts & Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **DOCUMENT CANCELLED**: This PCN was cancelled and work was completed "AS BUILT"
   - **Impact**: Any specifications in this document may not reflect actual field conditions
   - **Action Required**: Verify as-built conditions if reconciling project documentation

2. **Approval Dependencies**: Item 3.0 creates a hard stop
   - Slab work cannot proceed without sub-grade approval
   - Potential for schedule delays if approval process is unclear

3. **Cost Allocation Ambiguity**: Item 5.0
   - Additional geotechnical work costs require opinion letter
   - Approval needed from both Owner AND General Contractor
   - Potential for dispute if weak areas are discovered

4. **Vague Language**: Item 4.0
   - "may be subject" creates uncertainty about protection requirements
   - Not clear who determines if protection is needed

### Coordination Requirements
1. **Civil vs. Structural**: Crown elevation (Item 1.0) must coordinate with:
   - Finished floor elevation
   - 0-11" below FFE requirement
   - Civil grading plans

2. **Geotechnical vs. Construction Schedule**:
   - Multiple inspection/approval gates
   - Sub-grade approval before slab (Item 3.0)
   - Weak area identification and remediation (Item 5.0)

3. **Material Procurement**:
   - 6" clear crushed stone with fines (Item 2.0)
   - Gravel or granular fill for protection (Item 4.0)
   - Verify availability before backfill operations

---

## 6. Code Compliance Notes

### Building Code Considerations
- No specific building code sections referenced
- Geotechnical requirements suggest compliance with:
  - Local soils engineering standards
  - Structural design requirements for slab-on-grade
  - Drainage and frost protection requirements

### Standards & Best Practices
1. **Geotechnical Engineering**:
   - Multiple approval checkpoints suggest regulatory compliance requirements
   - DGE oversight indicates structural safety concerns

2. **Drainage Requirements**:
   - 6" crushed stone layer (Item 2.0) suggests:
     - Vapor barrier/drainage requirements
     - Prevention of capillary rise
     - Potential radon mitigation strategy

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Designer approval requirement (Item 3.0)
   - Geotechnical engineer oversight (Item 5.0)
   - Multiple inspection gates align with quality control best practices

## 8. Schedule & Timeline Implications

### Date Information
- **PCN Issue Date**: April 3, 2025
- **Implication**: This is relatively late in construction timeline
- **Cancellation**: Marked "AS BUILT" suggesting field conditions already established

### Critical Path Items
1. **Earthwork pad preparation** (Item 1.0) - Foundation for all subsequent work
2. **Backfill replacement** (Item 2.0) - Must precede geotextile work
3. **Sub-grade approval** (Item 3.0) - Gate before slab construction
4. **Geotechnical verification** (Item 5.0) - Potential for schedule impact if issues found

### Potential Delays
- Geotechnical approval process (Items 3.0 and 5.0)
- Discovery of weak subgrade areas requiring remediation
- Cost approval process for additional geotechnical work

---

## 9. Technical Observations

### Soil/Foundation Conditions
- **Concern**: Excess backfill and clay materials present (Item 2.0)
- **Solution**: Replacement with crushed stone for drainage
- **Indication**: Poor native soil conditions or imported fill concerns
- **Risk**: Potential for additional weak areas (Item 5.0 anticipates this)

### Drainage Strategy
- 6" clear crushed stone layer provides:
  - Capillary break
  - Ventilation to underside of slab
  - Drainage path for moisture
- Extends below AND around entire slab perimeter

### Construction Sequence
1. Earthwork and grading to Civil drawings
2. Remove unsuitable backfill/clay
3. Place 6" crushed stone layer
4. Prepare subgrade per DGE manual
5. Obtain subgrade approval from Designer
6. Protect subgrade during construction traffic
7. Geotechnical engineer inspection/testing
8. Remediate weak areas if identified
9. Obtain cost approval for extra work (if required)
10. Proceed with slab construction

## 11. Recommendations & Action Items

### For Documentation
- [ ] Update project records to reflect PCN cancellation status
- [ ] Verify as-built conditions match intended earthwork/backfill requirements
- [ ] Confirm final subgrade approval was obtained before slab construction
- [ ] Archive this PCN with clear CANCELLED status

### For Future Reference
- [ ] If discrepancies found in slab performance, review if cancelled items were still needed
- [ ] Check if drainage provisions (6" crushed stone) were actually installed
- [ ] Verify geotechnical inspections and approvals are in project files
- [ ] Confirm cost reconciliation for any geotechnical work performed

### For Similar Projects
- PCN provides useful template for landlord pad preparation requirements
- Approval gate structure (Item 3.0) is good quality control practice
- Cost approval process (Item 5.0) provides clear change order pathway
- Multiple inspection checkpoints help ensure quality

## 12. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks (if PCN had proceeded)
- **HIGH**: Subgrade failure if weak areas not identified/remediated
- **MEDIUM**: Drainage issues if crushed stone layer not properly installed
- **MEDIUM**: Schedule delays from multiple approval gates

### Commercial Risks (if PCN had proceeded)
- **MEDIUM**: Cost overruns from additional geotechnical work
- **MEDIUM**: Disputes over responsibility for weak area remediation
- **LOW**: Material procurement delays (standard materials specified)

### Current Risks (document cancelled)
- **MEDIUM**: Uncertainty about what was actually built ("AS BUILT" annotation)
- **LOW**: Documentation gaps if as-built drawings not updated
- **LOW**: Future maintenance/repair challenges if drainage layer not installed

## Summary

This PCN was issued on April 3, 2025, to address landlord pad preparation requirements for the Aurora (Safeway) project in Regina, SK. The document specified comprehensive earthwork, backfill, and geotechnical requirements including a 6" clear crushed stone drainage layer and multiple approval gates. However, the PCN was **CANCELLED** with an "AS BUILT" notation, indicating that field conditions superseded these proposed changes. The actual as-built conditions should be verified through project as-built documentation to understand what site preparation methods were ultimately employed.
