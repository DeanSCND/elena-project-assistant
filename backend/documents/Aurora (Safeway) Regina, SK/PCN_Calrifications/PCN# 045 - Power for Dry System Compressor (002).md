GLOSSARY

GENERAL
INFORMATION

CFM: Cubic feet per minute.

This air compressor requires oil.
Now you can enjoy all the
benefits of having an oil
lubricated professional air
compressor. When oil is changed
regularly, it will give you long,
trouble-free life.

SCFM: Standard cubic feet per
minute; a unit of measure of air
delivery.

PSIG: Pounds per square inch
gauge; a unit of measure of
pressure.

Your air compressor can be used
for operating paint spray guns,
air tools, caulking guns, grease
guns, air brushes, sandblaster,
inflating tires or spraying weed
killers, insecticides, etc. An air
pressure regulator is supplied for
these applications.

CUT-IN PRESSURE: While the
motor is off, air tank pressure
drops as you continue to use
your accessory or air tool. When
the tank pressure drops to a
certain level the motor will restart
automatically re-started is called
"cut-in pressure".

Separate air transformers which
combine the functions of air
regulation and/or moisture and
dirt removal should be used
where applicable.

CUT-OUT PRESSURE: When
you turn on your air compressor,
it begins to run, air pressure in
the air tank begins to build. It
builds to a certain pressure
before the motor automatically
shuts off - protecting your air
tank from pressure higher than
its design rating. The pressure at
which the motor shuts off is
called "cut-out pressure". 

ON-RECEIPT
INSPECTION

DAMAGE: Each air compressor
outfit is carefully tested and
checked before shipment. With
improper handling, damage may
result in transit and cause
problems with compressor
operation.

DUTY CYCLE

All Makita manufactured air
compressors are recommended
to be operated on not more than
a 50% duty cycle. This means an
air compressor that pumps air
more than 50% of one hour is
considered misuse because the
air compressor is undersized for
the required air demand. 

Immediately upon arrival, check
equipment for both concealed
and visible damages to avoid
expenses being incurred to
correct such problems. This
should be done regardless of
any visible signs of damage to
the shipping container. If this

switch and to “off” to remove
power when finished using the
compressor or when compressor
will be left unattended.

product was shipped directly to
you, report any damages to the
carrier and arrange for inspection
of goods immediately.

AIR INTAKE FILTER: This filter is
designed to clean air coming into
the compressor pump. This filter
must always be clean and free
from obstructions. See
“Maintenance”.

STORAGE

Before you store the air
compressor, make sure you do
the following: 
1. Review the “Maintenance” and
“Operating Procedures”
sections and perform
maintenance as necessary. Be
sure to drain water from the 
air tank.
2. Protect the electrical cord and
air hose from damage (such as
being stepped on or run over). 
Store the air compressor in a
clean and dry location.

AIR COMPRESSOR PUMP: To
compress air, the piston moves
up and down in the cylinder. On
the down stroke, air is drawn in
through the air intake valve. The
exhaust valve remains closed.
On the upstroke of the piston, air
is compressed. The intake valve
closes and compressed air is
forced out through the exhaust
valve, through the outlet tube,
through the check valve and into
the air tank. Useable air is not
available until the compressor
has raised the air tank pressure
above that required at the air
outlet.

DESCRIPTION OF
OPERATION

DRAIN VALVE: The drain valve
is located at the bottom of the
air tank and is used to drain
condensation at the end of 
each use.

CHECK VALVE: When the air
compressor is operating, the
check valve is “open”, allowing
compressed air to enter the air
tank. When the air compressor
reaches “cut-out” pressure, the
check valve “closes”, allowing air
pressure to remain inside the air
tank.

MOTOR THERMAL OVERLOAD
PROTECTOR: The electric motor
has a manual thermal overload
protector. If the motor overheats
for any reason, the thermal
overload protector will shut off
the motor. Turn pressure switch
to the “off” position and wait for
unit to cool before pushing the
reset button and restarting the
compressor.

PRESSURE SWITCH
UNLOADING VALVE: The
pressure switch unloading valve
located on the side of the
pressure switch, is designed to
automatically release
compressed air from the
compressor head and the outlet
tube when the air compressor

ON/AUTO - OFF SWITCH: Turn
this switch to “on” to provide
automatic power to the pressure

reaches “cut-out” pressure.
PRESSURE SWITCH: The
pressure switch automatically
starts the motor when the air
tank pressure drops to the
factory set “cut-in” pressure. It
stops the motor when the air
tank pressure reaches the
factory set “cut-out” pressure.

accessory, the outlet regulated
air pressure may have to be
adjusted while you are operating
the accessory. 

INSTALLATION AND
BREAK-IN
PROCEDURES

SAFETY VALVE: If the pressure
switch does not shut off the air
compressor at its “cut-out”
pressure setting, the safety valve
will protect against high pressure
by “popping out” at its factory set
pressure (slightly higher than the
pressure switch “cut-out” setting).

LOCATION OF THE AIR
COMPRESSOR
Locate the air compressor in a
clean, dry and well-ventilated
area. The air filter must be kept
clear of obstructions, which could
reduce air delivery of the air
compressor. The air compressor
should be located at least 12
inches away from the wall or
other obstructions that will
interfere with the flow of air. The
air compressor head and shroud
are designed to allow for proper
cooling. If humidity is high, an air
filter can be installed on the air
outlet adapter to remove
excessive moisture. Follow the
instructions packaged with the air
filter for proper installation.

OUTLET PRESSURE GAUGE:
The outlet pressure gauge
indicates the air pressure
available at the outlet side of the
regulator. This pressure is
controlled by the regulator and is
always less or equal to the tank
pressure. See “Operating
Procedures”.

TANK PRESSURE GAUGE: The
tank pressure gauge indicates
the air pressure in the tank.

LUBRICATION AND OIL
CAUTION: Do not attempt to
operate this air compressor
without first adding oil to the
crankcase. Serious damage will
result from even limited operation
unless filled with oil and broken
in correctly. Make sure to closely
follow initial start-up procedures.
Compressor oil is provided; on a
level surface, please fill the
crankcase to proper level
indicated on the sight glass.

REGULATOR: The air pressure
coming from the air tank is
controlled by the regulator knob.
Turn the knob clockwise to
increase pressure and counter-
clockwise to decrease pressure.
To avoid minor re-adjustment
after making a change in
pressure setting, always
approach the desired pressure
from a lower pressure. When
reducing from a higher to a lower
setting, first reduce to some
pressure less than desired
pressure. Depending on the air
requirements of each particular

WARNING: Compressors are
shipped without oil. A small

CAUTION: Multi-Viscosity motor
oils, like 10W 30, should not be
used in an air compressor. They
leave carbon deposits on critical
components, thus reducing
performance and compressor
life. Use air compressor oil only.

Initial Start Up Procedure:
1.Open the air receiver's drain
valve.
2.Plug power supply cord into
correct power source.
3.Run the compressor for a
minimum of twenty (20)
minutes in the no-load
condition to lubricate the
bearings and pistons, and to
seat the piston rings.
4.Close air receiver drain valve.
Your compressor is now ready
for use.

Piping
Plastic or PVC pipe is not
designed for use with
compressed air. Regardless of its
indicated pressure rating, plastic
pipe can burst from air pressure.
Use only metal pipe for air
distribution lines.
If a pipe line is necessary, use
pipe that is the same size, or
larger than, the air tank outlet.
Piping that is too small will
restrict the flow of air. If piping is
over 100 feet long, use the next
larger size. Bury underground
lines below the frost line and
avoid pockets where
condensation can gather and
freeze. Apply pressure before
underground lines are covered to
make sure all pipe joints are free
of leaks.

Extension Cords
To avoid voltage drop, power
loss, and overheating of the
motor, use extra air hose instead
of an extension cord. Low
voltage can cause damage to the
motor.

If an extension cord must be
used:
· Use only an approved 3-wire
extension cord that has a 3-
blade grounding plug and a 3-
slot receptacle that will accept
the plug on the air compressor.
· Make sure the extension cord
is in good condition.

Grounding Instruction
WARNING: Risk of electric
shock! In the event if a short
circuit, grounding reduces the
risk of shock by providing an
escape wire for the electric
current. This air compressor
must be properly grounded.
The air compressor is equipped
with a cord having a grounding
wire with an appropriate

Page 10

4. Open the regulator by turning
it clockwise. Adjust the
regulator to the correct
pressure setting. Your
compressor is ready for use. 
5. Always operate the air
compressor in well-ventilated
areas; free of gasoline or
other solvent vapors. Do not
operate the compressor near
the spray area. 

grounding plug. The plug must
be used with an outlet that has
been installed and grounded in
accordance with all local codes
and ordinances. The outlet must
have the same configuration as
the plug. DO NOT USE AN
ADAPTER.

Inspect the plug and cord before
each use. Do not use if there are
signs of damage.

When you are finished:
6. Set the pressure switch lever
to “OFF”. 
7. Using the air tool or
accessory, bleed the tank
pressure down to zero. 
8. Remove the air tool or
accessory. 
9. Drain water from air tank by
opening drain cock valve on 
bottom of tank. WATER WILL
CONDENSE IN THE AIR
TANK. IF NOT DRAINED,
WATER WILL CORRODE
AND WEAKEN THE AIR
TANK CAUSING A RISK OF
AIR TANK RUPTURE.

DANGER: Improper grounding
can result in electrical shock. Do
not modify the plug that has
been provided. If it does not fit
the available outlet, the correct
outlet should be installed by a
qualified electrician. 

OPERATING
PROCEDURES

Daily Start-up Checklist 
1. Before attaching air hose or
accessories, make sure the
pressure switch lever is set to
“OFF” and the air regulator or
shut-off valve is closed. 
2. Attach hose and accessories. 
Too much air pressure causes
a hazardous risk of bursting.
Check the manufacturer's
maximum pressure rating for
air tools and accessories. The
regulator outlet pressure must
never exceed the maximum
pressure rating.
3. Turn the pressure switch lever
to “ON/AUTO” and allow tank
pressure to build. Motor will
stop when tank pressure
reaches “cut-out” pressure. 

Note:
If drain cock valve is plugged,
release all air pressure. The
valve can then be removed,
cleaned, then reinstalled.

10. After the water has been
drained, close the drain valve.
The air compressor can now
be stored.

modifications will depend upon
the hours of operation and the
working environment.
Compressor units in an
extremely dirty and/or hostile
environment will require a
greater frequency of all
maintenance checks.

Filling with Oil:
1.Remove the oil filler plug.
2.Slowly pour the proper oil into
the pump crankcase.
3.Always keep oil level in the
middle of the sight glass.

Changing the Oil:
Note: Every 300 hours or 3
months, whichever comes first.
1.Remove the oil drain plug.

SERVICE
INSTRUCTIONS

Air Filter - Inspection and
Replacement:
• Keep the air filter clean at all
times. Do not operate the
compressor with the air filter
removed.
• A dirty air filter will not allow
the compressor to operate at
full capacity. Before you use
the compressor, check the air
filter to be sure it is clean. 
• If it is dirty, check and replace
the filter element.

WARNING: SAFETY
VALVE – INSPECTION
IF THE SAFETY VALVE 
DOES NOT WORK 
PROPERLY, OVER-
PRESSURIZATION MAY
OCCUR, CAUSING AIR 
TANK RUPTURE OR 
AN EXPLOSION.
OCCASIONALLY PULL
THE RING ON THE 
SAFETY VALVE TO MAKE
SURE THAT THE SAFETY
VALVE OPERATES FREELY.
IF THE VALVE IS STUCK 
OR DOES NOT OPERATE
SMOOTHLY, IT MUST BE
REPLACED WITH THE 
SAME TYPE OF VALVE. 

Motor
The motor has a manual reset
thermal overload protector
switch. If the motor overheats for
any reason, the overload
protector will shut off the motor.
The motor must be allowed to
cool down before resetting the
overload switch and restarting. 

If the overload protector shuts
the motor off frequently, check
for a possible voltage problem.
Low voltage can also be
suspected when: 
1. The motor does not get up to
full power or speed. 
2. Fuses blow out when starting
the motor; lights dim and
remain dim when motor is
started and is running.

WARNING
Some dust created by power sanding, sawing, grinding, drilling, and
other construction activities contains chemicals known to the State of
California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.
Some examples of these chemicals are:
• lead from lead-based paints,
• crystalline silica from bricks and cement and other masonry
products, and
• arsenic and chromium from chemically-treated lumber. 

Your risk from these exposures varies, depending on how often you
do this type of work. To reduce your exposure to these chemicals:
work in a well ventilated area, and work with approved safety
equipment, such as those dust masks that are specially designed to
filter out microscopic particles.

rights which vary from state to state. Some states do not allow the exclusion
or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
exclusion may not apply to you. Some states do not allow limitation on how
