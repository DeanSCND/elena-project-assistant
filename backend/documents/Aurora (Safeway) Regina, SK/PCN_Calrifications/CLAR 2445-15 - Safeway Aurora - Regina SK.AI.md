## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Coordination Items

**1. Structural Coordination**:
- 6" steel studs require coordination with floor/ceiling connections
- Pony wall height (54") requires verification of clearances with overhead systems
- Corner guard installation may affect dimensional tolerances

**2. Mechanical/Electrical Coordination**:
- Verify no conflicts with outlets, switches, or data ports at 54" height
- Customer Service and Floral areas may require integrated electrical/data
- Stainless steel cap may affect wire routing

**3. Finish Coordination**:
- Full-height laminate application eliminates gypsum board - verify this change doesn't affect:
  - Fire rating requirements for pony walls
  - Acoustic performance expectations
  - Budget implications (laminate vs. painted gypsum)
- Grain direction coordination across multiple applications
- Rubber base color selection and coordination with adjacent finishes

**4. Millwork Coordination**:
- PL3 material is used extensively across multiple millwork items
- Grain direction must be verified on shop drawings for each application
- Digital reproduction on trellis & datum requires coordination with graphics/signage consultant

**5. Dimensional Verification**:
- 54" height should be verified against ADA/accessibility requirements for transaction counters
- Corner guard projection needs to be accounted for in circulation clearances

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Counter Height**: 54" pony walls at Customer Service may require accessibility compliance review
  - Typical accessible counter height: 28"-34" maximum
  - If these are service counters, a portion must meet accessible height requirements
  - Verify if separate accessible transaction surfaces are provided

### Fire & Life Safety
- **Material Compliance**:
  - Formica laminate (PL3) must meet flame spread and smoke development ratings
  - Typical requirement: Class A or B interior finish (per NBC/local codes)
  - Verify laminate manufacturer's certifications for commercial interior use

- **Partition Requirements**:
  - At 54" height, these are partial-height partitions (not full-height fire separations)
  - Steel stud framing adequate for non-rated partition
  - No fire rating indicated in this clarification

### Building Code References
- **Guard Requirements**:
  - 54" height is below typical guard height requirements (42" minimum in many jurisdictions)
  - These appear to be space-defining partitions, not guards/barriers
  - Verify these are not located at elevation changes

- **Material Installation**:
  - Steel stud framing must comply with CSA standards
  - Corner guards should meet impact resistance requirements for commercial applications
  - Stainless steel cap must be securely fastened per manufacturer requirements

### Installation Notes
- Rubber base installation must meet commercial standards
- Grain direction requirements suggest quality control importance
- Full-height laminate application requires proper substrate preparation

## 6. SCOPE & IMPACT SUMMARY

### Scope Definition
This clarification explicitly states:
- "There will be no change to Contract Price or construction schedule"
- This is clarification and authorization, not a change order
- If changes occur, Architect must be notified for appropriate action

### Work Affected
- Customer Service pony walls
- Floral pony walls
- Related millwork items using PL3 material

### Key Decisions Documented
1. Wall height confirmed at 54"
2. Framing system: 6" steel studs
3. Finish: Full-height PL3 laminate (no painted gypsum board)
4. Top cap: Stainless steel
5. Protection: Corner guards required
6. Base: Rubber base
7. Grain direction requirements specified for different applications

---

## 7. ACTION ITEMS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Contractor
- [ ] Verify 6" steel stud availability and lead time
- [ ] Confirm stainless steel cap profile and finish selection
- [ ] Obtain corner guard specifications and color selection
- [ ] Coordinate rubber base color with owner/architect
- [ ] Review shop drawings for all PL3 applications to verify grain direction compliance
- [ ] Verify no conflicts with previously issued millwork shop drawings

### For Design Team
- [ ] Confirm accessibility compliance at Customer Service counter
- [ ] Verify fire rating requirements (if any) are met with specified materials
- [ ] Provide corner guard detail/specification if not already issued
- [ ] Provide stainless steel cap profile detail
- [ ] Review PCN 2445-28 and PCN 2445-48 for consistency
- [ ] Confirm material quantities are adequate for full-height application

### For Review
- [ ] Structural engineer to verify steel stud framing adequacy
- [ ] Mechanical/electrical to confirm no conflicts at pony wall locations
- [ ] Code consultant (if applicable) to verify accessibility and fire compliance
- [ ] Cost estimator to confirm no cost impact despite material changes

## 8. TECHNICAL NOTES

### Material Properties - Formica 8906-58
- Type: High-pressure decorative laminate (HPDL)
- Appearance: Light wood grain (Danish Maple)
- Finish: Matte (reduces glare, hides fingerprints)
- Expected performance: Commercial grade, impact resistant, cleanable
- Typical thickness: 0.048" (standard) or 0.039" (vertical grade) - verify with specification

### Steel Stud Framing
- 6" studs provide adequate depth for:
  - Structural stability at 54" height
  - Potential electrical rough-in
  - Laminate substrate attachment
- Typical gauge: 20ga or 18ga for non-load-bearing partitions
- Spacing: Verify per specification (typically 16" or 24" o.c.)

### Installation Sequence Considerations
1. Steel stud framing
2. Substrate (likely gypsum board or plywood for laminate backing)
3. Corner guard installation
4. PL3 laminate application (full height)
5. Stainless steel cap installation
6. Rubber base installation
