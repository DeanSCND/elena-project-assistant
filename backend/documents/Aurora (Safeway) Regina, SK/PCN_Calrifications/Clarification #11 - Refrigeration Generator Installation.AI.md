## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Design Changes

**Deleted Elements**:
- **Sleeper Curbs**: Previously specified below rooftop generator
  - Complete removal from design
  - Replaced with concrete paver/insulation system

**Potential Coordination Concerns**:

1. **Height Change Impact**:
   - Sleeper curbs (deleted) typically 6"-12" tall
   - New system: 2" insulation + 2" pavers = 4" total height
   - Net reduction in generator mounting height: 2"-8" lower than original design
   - **CHECK**: Impact on exhaust termination heights
   - **CHECK**: Electrical conduit routing adjustments
   - **CHECK**: Gas line routing modifications

2. **Structural Loading**:
   - Concrete pavers create point loads vs. distributed curb loads
   - **VERIFY**: Roof structure can support concentrated paver loads
   - **VERIFY**: No roof penetrations/drains under paver locations
   - **VERIFY**: Structural engineer approval of revised support method

3. **Water Management**:
   - Sleeper curbs elevate equipment above roof water
   - 4" elevation may be insufficient for drainage during heavy rain/snow melt
   - **CHECK**: Minimum equipment elevation above roof drain high point
   - **CHECK**: Compatibility with roof warranty requirements
   - **VERIFY**: Generator manufacturer clearance requirements

4. **Insulation Continuity**:
   - Rigid SM insulation below pavers interrupts roof insulation layer
   - **VERIFY**: Thermal bridging analysis
   - **CHECK**: Compatibility with roof membrane warranty
   - **CHECK**: Insulation compression under generator weight

5. **Electrical Coordination**:
   - "Refer to Electrical" note requires:
     - Updated electrical routing drawings
     - Generator disconnect location verification
     - Conduit support modifications

### Installation Sequencing Issues

- **Paver Placement**: Must verify roof membrane fully cured before paver installation
- **Generator Setting**: Pavers must be level and properly supported
- **Insulation Protection**: SM insulation susceptible to damage during installation

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Building Code Considerations

**IBC/NBC Requirements** (Likely Applicable):

1. **Rooftop Equipment Supports**:
   - Adequate bearing surface required
   - Non-combustible materials (concrete pavers comply)
   - Proper anchorage for wind/seismic loads
   - **VERIFY**: Generator seismic restraint details not shown

2. **Fire Separation**:
   - Rigid SM insulation fire rating considerations
   - Equipment separation from roof assembly
   - **CHECK**: Type SM insulation flame spread/smoke development ratings

3. **Structural Loading**:
   - Dead load: Generator + pavers + insulation
   - Live load: Maintenance access
   - Snow load: Drifting around equipment
   - **VERIFY**: Structural calculations updated for revised support

### Electrical Code (Canadian Electrical Code)

1. **Generator Installation** (CEC Section 32):
   - Outdoor installation requirements
   - Disconnecting means within sight
   - Grounding and bonding
   - **COORDINATION**: Electrical drawings must show compliance

2. **Clearances**:
   - Working space around electrical equipment
   - Ventilation for combustion air (if fuel-fired)
   - **VERIFY**: Adequate clearances maintained with 4" mounting height

### Energy Code

1. **Thermal Bridging**:
   - SM insulation below pavers creates thermal break
   - May create localized thermal bridging through pavers
   - **EVALUATE**: Impact on overall roof R-value compliance

### Manufacturer Requirements

1. **Generator Specifications**:
   - **VERIFY**: Manufacturer minimum mounting height
   - **VERIFY**: Vibration isolation requirements
   - **VERIFY**: Clearance to combustibles
   - **VERIFY**: Warranty implications of mounting method

2. **Roof Membrane Warranty**:
   - **VERIFY**: Roofing manufacturer approval of pavers on insulation
   - **VERIFY**: Compatibility of SM insulation with roof system
   - **VERIFY**: Warranty exclusions for equipment areas

---

## 6. Additional Technical Notes

### Installation Considerations

1. **Paver Layout**:
   - 2' × 2' pavers require planning for generator footprint
   - Minimum 4 pavers required for typical small generator
   - Level installation critical for vibration control

2. **Insulation Installation**:
   - SM insulation must be protected from UV exposure
   - Gaps between insulation boards should be minimized
   - Consider adhesive or mechanical attachment to prevent wind uplift

3. **Drainage**:
   - Water must drain freely around pavers
   - No ponding under or around generator base
   - Consider sloped pavers or tapered insulation if needed

### Quality Control Checklist

- [ ] Verify roof membrane integrity before paver placement
- [ ] Confirm insulation R-value and type (SM)
- [ ] Level check all pavers before generator setting
- [ ] Verify electrical rough-in coordinates with new mounting height
- [ ] Structural engineer approval of revised support system
- [ ] Generator manufacturer approval of mounting method
- [ ] Roofing contractor warranty review
- [ ] Final inspection coordination between trades
