## 6. COORDINATION NOTES

**Trades Involved:**
1. **Electrical Contractor:** Primary responsibility for all wiring and connections
2. **Door Hardware Supplier (Gunnebo):** Provide equipment and specifications
3. **General Contractor:** Coordinate door rough openings and installation
4. **Security Contractor:** Integrate electric strike with access control system
5. **Accessibility Consultant:** Verify compliance with barrier-free standards

**Potential Conflicts with Other Work:**
- **Door Frame Modifications:** Automatic operators require overhead mounting space
- **Wall Thickness:** Verify adequate space for electric strike in door frame
- **Power Availability:** Confirm electrical circuits available near doors 106 and 141
- **Security System:** Electric strike must integrate with access control system
- **Fire Rating:** Verify automatic operators don't compromise fire-rated assemblies if applicable
- **Ceiling Height:** Door operators require clear overhead space

**Sequence Dependencies:**
1. Review Gunnebo submittal and manufacturer's literature
2. Verify door frame compatibility with operators and electric strike
3. Confirm electrical requirements (voltage, current, control wiring)
4. Route power and control wiring to door locations
5. Install junction boxes and conduits
6. Coordinate with door installation
7. Install operators and electric strike
8. Wire and connect all components
9. Integrate electric strike with security/access control system
10. Test and commission
11. Verify barrier-free compliance

**Critical Coordination Points:**

### Door 106 - Universal Washroom:
- **Accessibility Critical:** Must meet all barrier-free code requirements
- **Camden Controls:** Typically requires push plates on both sides of door
- **Height Requirements:** Push plates must be at accessible height (typically 900-1100mm)
- **Activation Zone:** Must provide hands-free activation or large push plates
- **Power Location:** Needs accessible power source, likely from ceiling
- **Conduit Routing:** Conceal in walls/ceiling for aesthetic appearance

### Door 141 - Pharmacy:
- **Security Critical:** Electric strike must provide reliable access control
- **Fail-Safe vs Fail-Secure:** Determine proper mode for fire safety
  - Fail-safe: Door unlocks on power failure (typically required for egress)
  - Fail-secure: Door locks on power failure (for high security)
- **Fire Code:** Pharmacy may have special egress requirements
- **Access Control Integration:** Must wire to security system panel
- **Backup Power:** May require UPS backup for security system integration
- **Double Function:** Must coordinate automatic operator with electric strike operation

**Manufacturer Coordination:**
The PCN specifically requires confirming "exact requirements with Gunnebo and manufacturer's literature on site" - this indicates:
- Equipment not fully specified at PCN issuance
- Field conditions may vary
- Installer flexibility required
- Submittal review process essential

**Code Compliance:**
- **National Building Code of Canada (NBCC)**
- **CSA B651** (Accessible Design for the Built Environment)
- **Provincial accessibility legislation** (Saskatchewan)
- **Fire Code:** Ensure operators don't interfere with fire egress
- **Electrical Code:** CEC (Canadian Electrical Code) compliance

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MODERATE RISK** - Late addition to project (September)
- **SCHEDULE RISK** - Equipment lead time may be critical
- **COORDINATION RISK** - Multiple trades involved
- **COMPLIANCE RISK** - Must meet accessibility and security requirements

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **URGENT:** Order Gunnebo equipment immediately to avoid schedule delays
2. Obtain and review manufacturer's submittal data
3. Verify door frame compatibility with operators
4. Confirm power circuits available near both doors
5. Coordinate electric strike specifications with security system
6. Verify fire rating compatibility if doors are fire-rated
7. Plan conduit routing to conceal wiring
8. Schedule pre-installation coordination meeting with all trades
9. Verify barrier-free compliance with accessibility consultant
10. Plan testing and commissioning sequence
11. Coordinate with pharmacy equipment/layout plans for door 141
12. Update as-built drawings with final installations
