## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### 4.1 Design Evolution - Pit to Pipe Change

**Critical Design Change** (Rev 03 to Rev 04):
- **Original Design**: Prep area pits for refrigerant piping
- **Final Design**: Pits deleted, replaced with 8" PVC pipe under slab for CO2 lines
- **Implication**: This represents a significant construction methodology change
- **Coordination Required**: Structural/foundation work must accommodate PVC pipe sleeves before slab pour
- **Status**: Addressed in PCN 023, item 1.2

### 4.2 Piping Size Reduction

**Cases 40, 39, 37**:
- Suction line downsized to 5/8"
- Liquid line downsized to 1/2"
- **Potential Issue**: Verify that reduced pipe sizes maintain adequate capacity for these cases
- **Coordination**: Check with case manufacturer specifications for minimum line sizes

### 4.3 Coordination Disclaimers

**Multiple Schematic Warnings** (Pages 5 & 6):
```
FINAL PIPING PATH VALIDATION / COORDINATION
TO BE DONE BY REF. CONTRACTOR

NOT TO BE USED FOR CONSTRUCTION

SCHEMATIC FOR COORDINATION ONLY

SCALE: NONE
```

**Page 7 Note**:
```
IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REFRIGERATION
CONTRACTOR TO VALIDATE PIPING, PIPING ACCESS
PATHS. HE CAN MODIFY, AS NEEDED, ACCORDING TO
WORKSITE CONDITIONS.
```

**Implication**:
- Drawings are conceptual/coordination level only
- Refrigeration contractor must perform field verification
- Final routing to be determined on-site
- Potential for conflicts not identified on drawings

### 4.4 Architectural Coordination

**Revision 02 Reference**:
- Pit location revised to match A2.0 architectural plans
- **Suggests**: Initial refrigeration design may not have been fully coordinated with architectural layout
- **Risk**: Ongoing coordination required between trades

### 4.5 Structural/MEP Coordination Risks

**Potential Conflict Areas**:
1. **Under-slab piping**: 8" PVC pipe routing must avoid conflicts with:
   - Foundation footings
   - Plumbing rough-ins
   - Electrical conduits
   - Other utilities

2. **Overhead piping**: Blue refrigerant lines shown on layouts must coordinate with:
   - HVAC ductwork
   - Electrical conduit/cable tray
   - Sprinkler piping
   - Structural elements (beams, joists)
   - Ceiling height clearances

3. **Equipment access**: Rack "A" dimensions (210"x64"x77") require:
   - Adequate rigging/delivery path
   - Service clearances
   - Electrical/mechanical connection access

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### 5.1 Refrigerant Type

**CO2 Refrigerant System**:
- Natural refrigerant (R-744)
- Lower GWP (Global Warming Potential) compared to synthetic refrigerants
- Aligns with environmental regulations and Sobeys sustainability initiatives
- Requires specific safety considerations due to high operating pressures

### 5.2 Electrical Requirements

**From Refrigeration Schedule** (color-coded purple/lavender sections):
- Multiple voltage/phase requirements indicated
- Coordination with electrical drawings required for:
  - Circuit sizing
  - Disconnect locations
  - Branch circuit protection

### 5.3 Safety Equipment

**Noted on Floor Plan**:
- Eyewash Station (multiple locations indicated)
- Suggests compliance with ANSI Z358.1 for emergency eyewash/shower requirements
- Likely required due to refrigerant handling in butcher/prep areas

### 5.4 Accessibility & Clearances

**Equipment Heights**:
- Digital TVs at 50" and 75" (wall-mounted)
- Baby sign suspended at 9'-0" A.F.F. (Above Finished Floor)
- Equipment must maintain ADA clearances where applicable

### 5.5 Mechanical Code Compliance

**Refrigeration System**:
- Must comply with CSA B52 (Mechanical Refrigeration Code)
- CO2 systems require specific pressure relief and safety provisions
- Piping must meet CSA B51 (Boiler, Pressure Vessel and Pressure Piping Code)

**Ventilation**:
- Machinery rooms typically require mechanical ventilation
- Emergency shutoff controls required
- CO2 detection may be required depending on system charge

### 5.6 Building Code Considerations

**Saskatchewan Building Code (National Building Code of Canada)**:
- Equipment room construction (fire rating, access)
- Refrigerant piping penetrations through fire-rated assemblies
- Seismic restraint requirements for equipment and piping

### 6.3 Drawing Status

**Current Revision**: R03/04 (July 3, 2025)
- Recent updates indicate active design coordination
- Four revisions in 9-month period (Oct 2024 to Jul 2025) suggests evolving design

### 6.4 Construction Sequencing

**Critical Path Items**:
1. Under-slab PVC pipe installation (before slab pour)
2. Structural coordination for rack location/support
3. Electrical rough-in coordinated with equipment locations
4. Refrigeration contractor field verification before fabrication/installation

### 6.5 Specialty Equipment Integration

- Multiple digital TVs (50" and 75")
- Shopping cart storage (150 carts)
- Motorized shopping cart
- Floor mat (10'L x 10'W)
- Various food prep equipment

**Integration Consideration**: Refrigeration piping must route around these fixtures

## 7. ACTION ITEMS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 7.1 Immediate Actions Required

1. **Confirm PVC Pipe Routing**:
   - Coordinate 8" PVC under-slab routing with civil/structural
   - Verify no conflicts with foundation, plumbing, electrical
   - Confirm installation before slab pour schedule

2. **Validate Pipe Size Reduction**:
   - Verify cases 40, 39, 37 can operate with 5/8" suction / 1/2" liquid
   - Check manufacturer specifications
   - Confirm with refrigeration engineer

3. **Field Verification**:
   - Refrigeration contractor to walk site and verify piping routing feasibility
   - Identify any conflicts not shown on schematic drawings
   - Prepare final routing/coordination drawings for approval

### 7.2 Coordination Meetings Recommended

1. **MEP Coordination**:
   - Review overhead piping routes with HVAC, electrical, plumbing, sprinkler trades
   - Use 3D BIM coordination if available
   - Resolve conflicts before installation

2. **Architectural/Structural Review**:
   - Confirm equipment locations match architectural plans
   - Verify structural support for Rack "A" (210"x64"x77")
   - Confirm ceiling heights accommodate piping and equipment

### 7.3 Documentation Needs

1. **Submittals Required**:
   - Refrigeration equipment cut sheets
   - Piping material specifications
   - Control systems documentation
   - Electrical load schedules

2. **As-Built Documentation**:
   - Final piping routing (differs from schematic)
   - Equipment serial numbers
   - System commissioning reports

## 8. SUMMARY

This PCN updates the butcher shop refrigeration design with three key changes:

1. **Drawing replacement** with R03 revision dated July 3, 2025
2. **Under-slab methodology change**: 8" PVC pipe sleeve for CO2 refrigerant lines (replacing original pit design)
3. **Pipe size reduction**: Cases 40, 39, 37 branch lines reduced to 5/8" suction / 1/2" liquid

The refrigeration system is a CO2 dual-temperature system by EVAPCO Systems LMP, serving 60+ display cases and equipment throughout the butcher shop and prep areas. The drawings include detailed equipment schedules with color-coded specifications, and piping layouts for both low-temperature (LT) and medium-temperature (MT) circuits.

**Critical coordination required**: The piping layouts are explicitly marked as schematic/coordination only, with final routing responsibility on the refrigeration contractor. Multiple revisions (R00 through R04) indicate ongoing design evolution, requiring vigilant coordination with architectural, structural, and MEP trades.

**Key risks**: Under-slab work must be coordinated before slab pour; overhead piping coordination required; field verification mandatory before fabrication.
