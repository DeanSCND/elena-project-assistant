## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Technical Conflicts

1. **Circuit H-23 Load Capacity**:
   - **Issue**: Adding POS station (240W) to existing circuit H-23 which serves Hot Chicken Island (6.2 kW on 208V)
   - **Risk Level**: LOW - The POS station draws minimal power (240W), but contractor should verify total circuit capacity
   - **Recommendation**: Confirm circuit H-23 breaker rating and total connected load before connecting additional device

2. **Circuit Voltage Mismatch**:
   - **Issue**: Hot Chicken Island on H-23 operates at 208V-1PH, while POS Station requires 120V-1PH
   - **Analysis**: This suggests circuit H-23 may be a multi-wire branch circuit OR the schedule is showing equipment voltage vs circuit voltage
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Requires electrical contractor verification
   - **Recommendation**: Electrical contractor must confirm proper voltage availability and neutral conductor provision (per Note 7: "PROVIDE A NEUTRAL WIRE FOR ALL EQUIPMENT")

3. **Equipment Schedule Inconsistency**:
   - **Issue**: H-26 POS Station appears in the equipment schedule but the actual location on the plan is not clearly marked with H-26 designation
   - **Risk Level**: LOW - Location context is clear from PCN narrative
   - **Recommendation**: Electrical contractor should field-verify exact POS station location with Sobeys management prior to installation

### Coordination Requirements Flagged

4. **Multiple Trade Coordination**:
   - **Drawing Note 2**: "ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR TO CONFIRM ALL EQUIPMENT LOADS, CIRCUIT SIZES, AND MOUNTING HEIGHTS PRIOR TO ROUGH-IN"
   - **Drawing Note 5**: References coordination with mill work, mechanical, refrigeration contractor, sub trades, and Safeway management
   - **Issue**: POS station likely involves millwork/countertop integration
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Missed coordination could result in rework
   - **Recommendation**: Pre-installation meeting with GC, millwork, and Sobeys to confirm exact mounting location and heights

5. **Data Outlet Mounting Coordination**:
   - **Communications Note 8**: Data outlet at same height as receptacle with 2" separation
   - **Communications Note 9**: Coordinate with GC prior to rough-in
   - **Issue**: Requires simultaneous coordination of both power and data rough-in
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
   - **Recommendation**: Single site meeting with electrical contractor, data contractor, and GC to establish exact locations before rough-in

6. **Missing Detail**:
   - **Observation**: No specific detail showing POS station elevation or section
   - **Issue**: Mounting height not explicitly stated for receptacle (data is referenced at 24" A.F.F. on millwork)
   - **Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM
   - **Recommendation**: Field verification required; assume consistent with adjacent equipment or millwork-integrated installation

### Installation Sequencing Conflicts

7. **Existing vs. New Work**:
   - **Issue**: PCN states "wire and connect to existing circuit H-23" - suggests circuit already exists
   - **Question**: Is panel H already installed and energized?
   - **Risk Level**: LOW - Procedural issue
   - **Recommendation**: Verify if hot work permits or shutdown procedures required if panel H is energized

8. **Data Cabling Provider Responsibility**:
   - **General Note 1.1**: Data cabling supply and install by Sobeys and Convergint (not electrical contractor)
   - **Issue**: Electrical contractor provides infrastructure only (conduits, pathways), must coordinate handoff
   - **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Scope gap could delay completion
   - **Recommendation**: Clear documentation of interface point between electrical contractor (rough-in) and Convergint (cable pull and termination)

### Change Order Process Issues

9. **PCN Cover Sheet Warning**:
   - "No work is to be done before this matter is finalized and a 'Change Order' is issued"
   - **Current Status**: PCN issued, awaiting contractor pricing
   - **Risk**: Work performed prematurely without approved change order
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure proper change order approval sequence before mobilization
