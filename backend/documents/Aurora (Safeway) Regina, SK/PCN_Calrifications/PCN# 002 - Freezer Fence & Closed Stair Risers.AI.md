## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### 4.1 Potential Issues

**Chain Link Fence:**
1. **Height not specified**: Section 32 31 13 states "Height of fabric: As indicated" but no specific height dimension is provided in the PCN or visible in the plan view
2. **Ceiling/structure coordination**: No detail showing how fence terminates at ceiling - need coordination with:
   - Refrigeration piping/equipment above
   - Lighting fixtures
   - Sprinkler systems
   - Structural elements
3. **Door/gate requirement**: Plan does not clearly indicate if a gate is required for access between freezers
   - If gate required: swing direction, size, locking mechanism need clarification
   - Personnel access between freezers should be evaluated
4. **Floor penetration**: No detail on how posts are anchored in freezer floor
   - Freezer floors typically have insulation below
   - Moisture barrier integrity
   - Thermal bridging concerns
5. **Keynote numbering**: Keynote "##31" uses double hashtag - should verify if this matches existing keynote numbering system

**Closed Stair Risers:**
1. **Material not specified**: Closed riser material, thickness, and finish not detailed
   - Should match tread galvanizing and safety yellow paint
   - Need structural attachment method
2. **Weather sealing**: Exterior application requires weather-resistant closure
   - Drainage considerations (treads are open grate for drainage)
   - Ice/snow accumulation behind closed risers
3. **Maintenance access**: Closed risers may trap debris or ice
4. **Existing stair modification**: If stairs already constructed, retrofit method needed
5. **Code compliance driver**: Reason for closed riser requirement not stated
   - May be local building code requirement
   - Should verify with Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

### 4.2 Missing Information

1. Chain link fence height (critical dimension)
2. Gate location, size, and hardware (if required)
3. Fence post foundation detail for freezer floor
4. Closed riser material specification and attachment detail
5. Cost estimate or pricing (PCN states contractor to submit cost breakdown)
6. Schedule impact analysis

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### 5.1 Chain Link Fence

**Applicable Standards Referenced:**
- CAN/CGSB-138.1, 138.2, 138.3 (Chain link fence material and installation)
- CAN/CSA-A23.1/A23.2 (Concrete - if posts require concrete footings)
- CAN/CSA-G164-M (Hot dip galvanizing)
- ASTM A90/A90M (Zinc coating testing)

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Food safety separation requirement between different food storage areas
- Fire separation requirements between freezers (if applicable)
- Egress pathway consideration
- Local health department requirements for food storage facility divisions

### 5.2 Closed Stair Risers

**Code Compliance Driver:**
- Likely building code requirement for exterior stairs
- **NBC (National Building Code of Canada)** typically requires:
  - Riser openings shall not permit passage of 100 mm (4") sphere
  - Closed risers prevent objects/people from falling through
  - Safety requirement for public/employee access

**Safety Requirements:**
- Stair treads already specified as "safety yellow" indicating high-visibility safety requirement
- Open risers can be tripping hazard or allow items to fall through
- May be occupational health and safety requirement

### 5.3 Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

**PCN Statement:**
- "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- Indicates these changes require AHJ review and approval
- No work to proceed until Change Order issued

---

## 6. TECHNICAL NOTES

### 6.1 Submittal Requirements

Per Section 32 31 13:
- Submit in accordance with Section 01 30 00
- Shop Drawings to indicate:
  - Typical installation details
  - Post connections
  - Parts list

### 6.2 Installation Sequence

**Chain Link Fence:**
1. Layout fence line as indicated
2. Install terminal posts (corners, ends, straining points)
3. Install line posts between terminals
4. Install tops and caps
5. Install bottom tension wire
6. Stretch and fasten fabric
7. Secure fabric to rails and posts with tie wires
8. Touch up galvanizing damage with zinc-rich paint

**Quality Control:**
- Touch-up damaged galvanizing with two coats organic zinc-rich paint
- Pre-treat per manufacturer instructions

### 6.3 Material Properties

**Galvanizing Protection:**
- Fence fabric: Grade 2 per CAN/CGSB-138.1
- Pipe: 550 g/m² minimum
- Other fittings: Per CAN/CSA-G164

**Environmental Suitability:**
- Galvanized materials suitable for freezer environment (-18°C to -23°C typical)
- Aluminum hardware resists corrosion in cold/moisture conditions
- Material differential expansion should be considered

---

## 7. PROCUREMENT IMPACT

**New Trade/Supplier:**
- Chain link fence supplier/installer required
- Specialty trade not typically on grocery store construction
- Lead time considerations for materials

**Existing Trade Modification:**
- Steel fabricator for closed risers (likely already on project)
- Modification to existing exterior stair package

---

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

**Before Pricing:**
1. Confirm chain link fence height (floor to structure/ceiling)
2. Clarify if gate is required between freezers, and if so:
   - Size, swing direction, locking requirements
3. Provide detail for post foundation/floor penetration in freezer environment
4. Specify closed riser material, thickness, and attachment method
5. Confirm if existing stairs require retrofit or if this is for new construction
6. Review coordination with mechanical/electrical/fire protection systems at fence location

**For Design Team:**
1. Issue revised Detail 3/A6.2 showing closed riser construction
2. Issue fence elevation/section showing height and termination details
3. Verify keynote ##31 matches keynote schedule
4. Coordinate with refrigeration consultant on fence location impact

**For Contractor:**
1. Site verify existing stair construction status before pricing retrofit
2. Obtain specialty fence subcontractor pricing
3. Identify schedule impact for material procurement
4. Coordinate with operations on freezer access requirements

## 9. DOCUMENT CONTROL

**PCN Status:**
- Proposed Change Notice (not yet approved)
- Awaiting contractor pricing and schedule impact
- Awaiting AHJ review and approval
- Change Order required before work proceeds

**Specification Update:**
- Section 32 31 13 dated May 2013 (Sobeys Master Specification)
- Standard specification being added to project manual

**Document Date:**
- PCN issued: March 17, 2025
- 3 pages including cover

## SUMMARY

This PCN introduces two distinct modifications addressing functional separation and code compliance requirements. The chain link fence provides separation between different food storage areas (meat vs. grocery), while the closed stair risers address safety code requirements for exterior egress stairs. Both modifications require coordination with existing systems and clarification of several technical details before accurate pricing and scheduling can be determined.

**Critical path items:**
- Fence height specification
- Gate requirement determination
- Closed riser material and attachment detail
- AHJ approval

**Estimated complexity:** Medium - specialty trade required for fence, simple modification for stair risers.
