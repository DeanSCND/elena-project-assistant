## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Stated Coordination Requirements
**Critical Note from PCN**: "The Contractor is to coordinate the final layout with the structure and ductwork on site."

This indicates:
- Potential conflicts with structural elements (beams, columns)
- Potential conflicts with HVAC ductwork routing
- Field verification required before final installation
- Final routing may require additional minor adjustments beyond what's shown

### Specific Changes Required

**Conflict 1 - Grid Line G Area:**
- Original 3" pipe insufficient or conflicting with structure/ductwork
- Upgrade to 4" RWL required
- **Implication**: Increased drainage capacity OR clearance issue resolution

**Conflict 2 - Grid Line C Area:**
- Drain pipe location along GL C requires modification
- **Implication**: Likely conflict with:
  - Structural elements (beams running along grid line)
  - HVAC ductwork in sales floor area
  - Other building systems

### Potential Issues
1. **Slope Verification**: Multiple slope changes (1/4" and 1/8") require careful field verification to ensure adequate drainage
2. **Support Locations**: Pipe rerouting may require new support locations coordinated with structure
3. **Ceiling Height**: Changes to pipe routing may impact ceiling heights in affected areas
4. **Access**: Modifications in finished areas (sales floor near GL C) may require special access coordination

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Plumbing Code References
- **Rain Water Leaders (RWL)**: Storm drainage system separate from sanitary system (code requirement)
- **Pipe Sizing**: Appears to follow graduated sizing principle (larger pipes as more leaders combine)
- **Slope Requirements**:
  - 1/4" per foot slope = 2.08% grade (standard minimum for drainage)
  - 1/8" per foot slope = 1.04% grade (acceptable for larger diameter pipes)

### Applicable Codes (Likely)
- **National Plumbing Code of Canada** (as referenced by Saskatchewan)
- **Saskatchewan Building Code** amendments
- Local municipality (Regina) amendments and requirements

### Compliance Considerations
1. **Minimum Slope**: All specified slopes appear to meet or exceed minimum code requirements
2. **Pipe Sizing**: Graduated sizing from 3"-4" collectors to 6"-8" trunk lines follows proper hydraulic design
3. **Accessibility**: Changes must maintain required clearances in accessible routes
4. **Support Spacing**: Must comply with code requirements for pipe support intervals

### Authority Having Jurisdiction
- PCN header states: "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- Indicates changes subject to review by local building official/inspector
- No work to proceed without approved Change Order

## 6. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS SUMMARY

### Materials (Implied, not explicitly stated)
- Rain Water Leader piping (typically steel or PVC for internal horizontal runs)
- Roof drains connecting to RWL system
- Supports and hangers per code requirements

### Installation Requirements
1. Verify all dimensions on site before installation
2. Coordinate with structure and ductwork
3. Maintain specified slopes throughout
4. Provide proper supports at required intervals
5. Test system per plumbing code requirements

### Work Scope
- Remove existing 3" pipe near GL G
- Install new 4" RWL pipe near GL G
- Relocate/modify drain pipe parallel to GL C
- Coordinate and adjust as needed based on site conditions

## 7. CHANGE ORDER PROCESS

### Requirements per PCN Cover Sheet
1. **No work before authorization**: Change Order must be issued before proceeding
2. **Contractor submission required**:
   - Signed letter
   - Price including cost breakdown
   - Impact on construction schedule (if any)
3. **Review process**: Authority Having Jurisdiction review and approval

### Schedule Impact
- Document indicates potential impact to construction schedule must be reported
- Coordination with structure and ductwork suggests this may affect critical path
- Field verification required before final installation

## 10. SUMMARY OF CHANGES

**PCN #020 / Mechanical PCN #04** revises the rain water leader distribution system with two primary changes:

1. **Upgrade pipe size near Grid Line G**: Replace 3" pipe with 4" RWL to accommodate drainage requirements and/or resolve conflicts
2. **Relocate drain parallel to Grid Line C**: Adjust routing to avoid conflicts with structure/ductwork in central building area

**Critical Requirement**: Contractor must coordinate final layout with structural elements and HVAC ductwork in the field before proceeding with installation.

**Status**: Awaiting formal Change Order approval before work may commence.
