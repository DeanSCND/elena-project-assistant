## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### 4.1 Potential Conflicts

**Conflict #1: Door #119A Historical Confusion**
- **Issue**: Door #119A requirements were previously deleted in PCN 2445-07, now being referenced again as "deleted" in this PCN
- **Risk**: Potential confusion if contractor attempts to install or price equipment that was already removed from scope
- **Recommendation**: Verify door numbering hasn't changed and confirm this is truly redundant deletion

**Conflict #2: Multiple Security System Contractors**
- **Issue**: Document references both "Chubb" as alarm installer and generic "Sobeys security system representative" and "security system contractor"
- **Risk**: Unclear accountability if multiple vendors are involved (access control vs. intrusion vs. CCTV)
- **Recommendation**: Clarify scope boundaries between Chubb and other potential security vendors

**Conflict #3: Surface Mount vs. Concealed Conduit**
- **Issue**: General Note #2 allows surface mount in Warehouse 191, Receiving 190, and Compressor Room 300, but main PCN text (1.0.3) only mentions Stockroom, Compressor Room, and Receiving
- **Risk**: "Stockroom" vs. "Warehouse 191" may be different spaces; requires clarification
- **Recommendation**: Confirm if "Stockroom" = "Warehouse 191" or if there's a separate stockroom space

**Conflict #4: Credit for Deleted Items**
- **Issue**: PCN requests credit for deleted security items but doesn't provide itemized cost breakdown
- **Risk**: Contractor may not have original pricing for deleted items, especially if prior PCN 2445-07 already addressed some deletions
- **Recommendation**: Cross-reference original contract and PCN 2445-07 to ensure no double-credit for Door #119A

### 4.2 Coordination Requirements

- Original contract pricing may not have itemized individual security devices
- Recommendation: Review original electrical contractor bid and PCN 2445-07 to determine accurate credit

### 9.3 Net Cost Impact

**Likely Outcome**: Net cost increase due to:
1. Greater number of motion sensors, glass break sensors, temperature detectors
2. Centralized security panel requiring new circuits and data infrastructure
3. More stringent conduit requirements (concealed vs. surface mount)
4. Increased coordination requirements

**Contractor to Provide**:
- Itemized cost breakdown for all added devices and infrastructure
- Itemized credit for all deleted devices and infrastructure
- Schedule impact analysis (if any)
- Coordination cost (meetings, submittals, etc.)

## 11. ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

### 11.1 Document Quality
- **Completeness**: PCN package is comprehensive with symbols, legends, floor plan, and schedules
- **Clarity**: Drawing notes are clear and well-organized
- **Readability**: 1/8" = 1'-0" scale is adequate for overall layout but may require larger details for complex areas

### 11.2 Design Approach
- **Centralization**: Security panel in IT Room 114 centralizes all systems (good practice)
- **Redundancy**: Multiple camera types (360-degree, standard, weatherproof) provide comprehensive coverage
- **Life Safety**: Fire alarm interlock with security gate ensures code compliance
- **Flexibility**: Pull strings in all conduits allow for future cable upgrades

### 11.3 Best Practices Noted
- **Separate Pathways**: Each security system has dedicated conduit (prevents interference, easier troubleshooting)
- **Coordination Requirements**: Multiple explicit notes requiring coordination before rough-in
- **Concealed Wiring**: Professional appearance in customer-facing areas
- **Power and Data Co-location**: Security panels have both power and data for complete functionality

### 11.4 Areas for Improvement
- **Conduit Sizing**: Minimal 3/4" may be tight for some runs; consider upsizing for flexibility
- **Device Counts**: Floor plan doesn't clearly indicate total device counts for pricing verification
- **Detailed Routing**: No riser diagram or detailed conduit routing plan provided
- **Integration Details**: Limited information on how different security systems integrate (CCTV + access control + intrusion)

## CONCLUSION

PCN# 035 represents a significant revision to the security system design for the Aurora Food Store. The changes reflect a shift from perimeter-focused piezo alarms to a more comprehensive intrusion detection system with motion sensors, glass break detectors, and temperature monitoring. The centralization of the security panel in IT Room 114 improves system management but requires careful coordination during rough-in.

Critical success factors include:
1. Early coordination with Chubb Security for device locations
2. Accurate credit calculation for deleted items (especially Door #119A)
3. Proper conduit routing to avoid conflicts with other trades
4. Compliance with hazardous location requirements in Compressor Room 300
5. Integration with fire alarm system for life safety compliance

The electrical contractor should prioritize obtaining the Chubb layout and scheduling the coordination meeting to avoid delays during rough-in. The owner should facilitate this coordination and provide timely approvals for cost and schedule impacts.

**Estimated Net Impact**:
- **Cost**: Likely increase (more devices, centralized infrastructure)
- **Schedule**: Minimal impact if coordination occurs promptly
- **Quality**: Improved security coverage with modern intrusion detection system
