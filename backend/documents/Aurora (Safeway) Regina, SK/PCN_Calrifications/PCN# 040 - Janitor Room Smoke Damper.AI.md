- **Access:** Provide access panel within 1.5m of damper for inspection/maintenance
- **Manufacturer Requirements:** Follow written installation instructions exactly

### Electrical:
- **Dedicated Circuit:** Must be unswitched and clearly labeled
- **Circuit Protection:** Breaker must not trip under normal damper operation
- **Smoke Detector Power:** May be powered from fire alarm panel or dedicated circuit
- **Wiring Method:** Must meet code requirements for fire alarm wiring (plenum rated if in air stream)
- **Panel C1 Location:** Circuit runs from Compressor Room 300 to Room 107 - long run

### Fire Alarm:
- **Addressable vs. Conventional:** Coordinate detector type with fire alarm system
- **Zone Assignment:** Assign to appropriate fire alarm zone
- **Control Logic:** Program damper closure on local smoke detection
- **Notification:** Determine if damper closure triggers alarm or supervisory signal
- **Testing Frequency:** Duct smoke detectors typically require annual testing

### Architectural:

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Fire Damper vs. Fire/Smoke Damper:**

### Fire Damper (Original):
- Passive device (no power required)
- Fusible link melts at ~165°F (74°C)
- Closes on high temperature only
- Does not detect or respond to smoke
- Simpler, less expensive

### Fire/Smoke Damper (Revised):
- Active device (requires power)
- Motorized actuator (typically spring return)
- Closes on smoke detection OR high temperature
- Integrates with building automation/fire alarm
- More complex, higher cost
- Provides earlier response to fire conditions

**Janitor Room Context:**
Janitor/custodial rooms require special attention because:
- **Hazardous Materials:** Cleaning chemicals are flammable/toxic
- **Storage:** Concentrated combustible materials (paper, rags)
- **Ignition Sources:** Electrical equipment, water heaters
- **Code Requirements:** Often classified as hazardous storage
- **Smoke Spread:** Connected to building ventilation - can distribute smoke
- **Fire Risk:** Higher than typical spaces

**Duct Smoke Detector Placement:**
"Supply side of duct" means:
- Detector is in the duct supplying air TO the janitor room
- Detects smoke being drawn from the room into return system
- Earlier warning than room smoke detector
- Prevents smoke distribution to other areas
- Required by NFPA 90A for certain HVAC systems

**Code References:**
- **National Building Code of Canada (NBCC):** Fire protection requirements
- **NFPA 90A:** Standard for Installation of Air-Conditioning and Ventilating Systems
- **NFPA 72:** National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code
- **NFPA 80:** Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives
- **CEC (Canadian Electrical Code):** Electrical installation requirements
- **ULC Standards:** Canadian fire safety product standards

**Fire/Smoke Damper Operation:**
Typical control sequence:
1. Duct smoke detector senses smoke
2. Signal sent to fire alarm control panel
3. Fire alarm panel signals damper actuator to close
4. Damper closes (typically in <30 seconds)
5. Airflow to Room 107 shut off
6. Fire alarm may activate (depending on programming)
7. Building management system notified
8. Manual reset required after investigation

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Annual inspection of damper operation
- Annual testing of smoke detector
- Verification of fire rating integrity
- Actuator function test
- Access panel required for maintenance

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MODERATE-HIGH RISK** - Fire/life safety system
- **CODE COMPLIANCE CRITICAL** - Required for occupancy
- **INSPECTION REQUIRED** - Fire marshal/building inspector approval needed
- **SCHEDULE IMPACT** - Moderate, but necessary for final occupancy
- **COORDINATION COMPLEXITY** - Multi-trade integration

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Determine reason for upgrade (code requirement, inspection finding, design error)
2. Obtain manufacturer's literature for fire/smoke damper
3. Field verify ceiling height in Room 107
4. Determine if ceiling modification required
5. Order fire/smoke damper and duct smoke detector
6. Verify panel C1 capacity for additional circuit
7. Coordinate wire routing from Compressor Room 300 to Room 107
8. Schedule pre-installation coordination meeting (mechanical, electrical, fire alarm)
9. Verify fire alarm system capacity for additional device
10. Plan control sequence and programming
11. Schedule inspection with authority having jurisdiction
12. Develop commissioning procedure
13. Plan testing and verification
14. Update O&M manuals with maintenance requirements
15. Train building staff on system operation
