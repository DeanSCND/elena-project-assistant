### Trade Coordination
- **Miscellaneous Metals**: Responsible for HSS columns and base plate installation
- **Architecture**: Responsible for wall height specification (noted on structural detail)

---

## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Height Coordination:**
- Detail 18/S1.3 notes "SEE ARCH FOR HEIGHT"
- PCN specifies 54" high wall
- Requires verification that architectural height (54") is coordinated with structural detail
- Detail title indicates walls ">48" A.F.F. <96"" - 54" wall falls within this range ✓

**2. Base Plate Projection:**
- Detail specifically notes: "POSITION COLUMNS @ ENDS. 1'-0" FROM END OF WALL TO ENSURE BASE PLATE DOES NOT PROJECT INTO FINISHED FLOOR SPACE"
- Plan view shows 10" offset dimension - verify this accommodates base plate clearance
- Potential conflict: 10" < 12" (1'-0") specified in structural detail
- **REQUIRES CLARIFICATION**

**3. Column Spacing:**
- Maximum spacing: 10'-0" O.C.
- Plan dimensions show 4'-11" spacing
- Wall appears relatively short - verify number and location of HSS columns needed
- May only require columns at ends given apparent wall length

**4. Stud Wall Attachment:**
- Detail shows "FASTEN STEEL STUD TO EACH SIDE OF HSS COLUMN"
- Verify 6" studs accommodate HSS 76x76 (3"x3") column on one side while maintaining wall alignment

**5. Corner Condition:**
- Plan shows angled/curved corner configuration at service desk
- Corner guards specified
- Verify corner guard type is compatible with stainless steel cap detail
- Verify corner guard installation at angled corners

**6. Finish Coordination:**
- PL3 Danish Maple to match Customer Service
- Verify existing finish material availability
- Confirm finish application method compatible with steel stud wall

### Missing Information

**1. Foundation/Slab Condition:**
- Hilti HY200 epoxy anchors require specific concrete strength
- No concrete strength specified on detail
- Slab thickness not indicated - verify adequate depth for 4 1/2" embedment

**2. Cap Detail:**
- "Stainless steel cap" specified
- No detail reference for cap profile, attachment method, or gauge
- No specification for cap returns at wall ends

**3. Cove Base:**
- "Rubber cove base" specified
- No height or profile specification
- No color/finish to match specification

**4. Corner Guard Detail:**
- Corner guards specified but no detail reference
- No specification for type, height, or material

**5. Wall End Conditions:**
- Plan shows walls terminating at service desk
- No detail for wall-to-desk connection or transition

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Structural Requirements

**Anchorage:**
- Hilti HY200 epoxy anchor system specified
- 3/4" diameter anchors with 4 1/2" embedment
- **Code Note**: Verify anchor system complies with current building code (IBC/NBC)
- **Code Note**: Epoxy anchors may require special inspection per code

**Free-Standing Wall Stability:**
- Detail specifically addresses free-standing walls >48" A.F.F.
- HSS column spacing and base plate design must comply with lateral load requirements
- **Code Note**: Saskatchewan Building Code wind/seismic requirements for free-standing elements
- **Code Note**: 54" height approaches potential guardrail height - verify not required to meet guardrail standards

### Accessibility (Barrier-Free Design)

**Protruding Objects:**
- 54" high wall may create protruding object condition if not properly configured
- **Code Note**: Objects protruding >4" from wall must be <27" or >80" A.F.F. per accessibility codes
- Wall appears to be full-height partition (base to cap) - likely compliant
- **Code Note**: Verify corner guards do not create protruding hazard

**Service Desk Area:**
- Customer Service area may have accessibility requirements
- **Code Note**: Verify 54" wall does not impede accessible circulation routes
- **Code Note**: Verify wall placement maintains required clear floor space at service counter

### Fire/Life Safety

**Construction Type:**
- Steel stud wall with gypsum board (assumed - finish over studs)
- **Code Note**: Verify fire separation requirements if wall creates barrier
- Non-load bearing partition - typically not fire-rated unless specified

**Egress:**
- Plan shows Service Desk area (Room 103)
- **Code Note**: Verify new wall does not impact egress path width or configuration
- **Code Note**: Confirm wall does not reduce room area below minimum code requirements

### Material Compliance

**Hilti HY200 Anchors:**
- Proprietary anchor system
- **Code Note**: Verify current code acceptance/approval documentation
- **Code Note**: May require submittal to Authority Having Jurisdiction

**Stainless Steel Cap:**
- **Code Note**: Verify stainless steel finish complies with flame spread requirements if applicable
- Typically compliant for commercial retail use

### Installation Requirements

**Special Inspection:**
- Epoxy anchor installation may require special inspection
- **Code Note**: Verify AHJ requirements for inspection and testing
- **Code Note**: Confirm anchor pull-test requirements

**Structural Connection:**
- Steel stud to HSS column connection
- **Code Note**: Verify fastener type and spacing for code compliance
- **Code Note**: May require engineered connection if lateral loads are significant

## 6. TECHNICAL NOTES

### Construction Sequence

1. Layout column locations per plan (verify 1'-0" end clearance)
2. Core drill for epoxy anchors (verify slab condition adequate)
3. Install base plates with Hilti HY200 anchors
4. Erect HSS columns and verify plumb
5. Frame steel stud wall and fasten to HSS columns both sides
6. Install sheathing/backing for finish
7. Apply PL3 Danish Maple finish
8. Install stainless steel cap
9. Install rubber cove base
10. Install corner guards

### Quality Control Checkpoints

- Verify concrete strength before anchor installation
- Confirm anchor embedment depth (114mm/4.5")
- Verify column plumbness before stud installation
- Confirm finish match to existing Customer Service area
- Verify cap installation for proper drainage/cleaning
- Check corner guard alignment and attachment

### Submittal Requirements (Anticipated)

- Shop drawings for HSS columns and base plates
- Hilti HY200 anchor product data and ICC-ES report
- Stainless steel cap profile and finish
- PL3 Danish Maple finish sample/product data
- Corner guard type and finish
- Rubber cove base profile and color

## 7. SUMMARY OF SCOPE

This PCN adds two 54" high free-standing pony walls at the Customer Service Desk area (Room 103). The walls will be constructed with 6" steel studs supported by HSS 76x76x6.4 columns at maximum 10'-0" spacing, anchored to the concrete slab with epoxy anchors. Walls will receive PL3 Danish Maple finish to match existing Customer Service area, stainless steel cap at top, rubber cove base at bottom, and corner guards as required.

**Key Change**: Modification to Drawing A2.4 LARGE SCALE PLAN
**Structural Support**: Per Detail #18/S1.3
**Trade Coordination Required**: Architecture, Structural, Miscellaneous Metals

## 8. QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

1. **Base Plate Clearance**: Plan shows 10" offset but detail requires 1'-0" (12") clearance - which governs?
2. **Number of HSS Columns**: Based on apparent wall length, how many columns are required?
3. **Cap Detail**: Is there a separate detail for stainless steel cap profile and attachment?
4. **Corner Guard Specification**: What type and height of corner guards are required?
5. **Concrete Strength**: What is the existing slab strength for anchor calculations?
6. **Finish Application**: Is PL3 Danish Maple a laminate, veneer, or paint finish?
7. **Wall End Connections**: How do walls terminate/connect at service desk?
8. **Cove Base Height**: Standard 4" or 6" cove base?
