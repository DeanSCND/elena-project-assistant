## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### 4.1 Electrical Conflicts - RESOLVED BY THIS PCN

**Original Design Error:**
- Spiral Mixer was originally specified with 20A-3P breaker and #12 wire
- Equipment nameplate requires 5.7 kW at 208V-3PH
- **Calculated current**: 5.7 kW / (208V × √3 × 0.9 PF) ≈ 17.6A
- **Required breaker per NEC**: Minimum 22A (125% of 17.6A = 22A), next standard size = 25A or 30A
- **Actual requirement**: 45A-3P breaker suggests equipment has higher inrush current or motor starting requirements

**Resolution:**
- PCN #32 corrects circuit breaker to 45A-3P
- Wire size upgraded to #8 AWG copper (rated 40A in conduit, adequate for 45A breaker with motor circuit rules)

### 4.2 Potential Coordination Issues

#### 4.2.1 Panel Capacity
- **Action Required**: Verify Panel 'B' has adequate capacity for upgraded 45A circuit
- Panel 'B' is 200A rated
- Need to verify panel schedule load calculations accommodate the change from 20A to 45A (+25A increase)
- Review if other spare/space circuits in Panel 'B' can accommodate the larger breaker

#### 4.2.2 Conduit Sizing
- **Action Required**: Confirm existing conduit rough-in can accommodate #8 wire
- If conduit was sized for #12 wire originally, may need upsizing
- Verify conduit fill calculations for all conductors (#8 is significantly larger than #12)

#### 4.2.3 Equipment Location and Clearances
- **Action Required**: Verify floor plan location accommodates 410 kg equipment
- Equipment dimensions: 75 cm (W) × 119 cm (D) × 145 cm (H)
- Requires adequate clearance for bowl access and operation
- Mounted on wheels but 410 kg weight requires proper floor support
- Verify electrical rough-in height and location matches equipment connection point

#### 4.2.4 Construction Schedule Impact
- PCN notes: "change (if any) to construction schedule"
- If electrical rough-in already complete with #12 wire and 20A breaker, rework required
- Contractor must submit cost breakdown and schedule impact

### 6.2 Equipment Features (from product literature)
- **Fixed bowl spiral mixer** (bowl does not rotate, only spiral arm)
- **New double pulley belt transmission** system
- **Heavy-thickness steel frame** mounted on wheels
- **Digital or electromechanical control panel** options
- **Bowl safety guard** in ABS (closed type) or with stainless steel grid
- **Multi-language documentation** (Italian, English, French, Spanish, German)

### 6.3 Power Calculation Verification

**Given Specifications:**
- Power: 5.7 kW
- Voltage: 208V-3PH
- Breaker: 45A-3P

**Calculated Current (3-phase):**
```
I = P / (√3 × V × PF)
Assuming 0.85 power factor (typical for motors):
I = 5700W / (1.732 × 208V × 0.85)
I = 5700 / 306.2
I ≈ 18.6 A full load current
```

**Code Required Conductor Capacity:**
- NEC 430.22: Motor circuit conductors = 125% × FLA
- Required capacity: 1.25 × 18.6A = 23.3A minimum

**Code Maximum Breaker Size:**
- NEC 430.52: Inverse time breaker = 250% × FLA maximum
- Maximum breaker: 2.5 × 18.6A = 46.5A
- Next standard size down: 45A ✓

**Analysis**: The 45A breaker is appropriately sized for motor starting current and protection. The #8 wire (40A ampacity) meets code requirements for 125% of FLA.
