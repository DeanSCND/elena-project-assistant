## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### 4.1 Critical Coordination Requirements

**GC Coordination Mandate** (explicitly stated):
1. **Architectural Drawings**: Ensure structural components kept within stud walls
2. **Roller Shutter Shop Drawings**: Ensure structure provided where required by shop drawings
3. **Dimensional Coordination**: Verify dimensions and locations match architectural intent

### 4.2 Potential Issues

**Window W12 Conflict**:
- Opening width may need reduction to accommodate framing
- Potential coordination needed with glazing contractor
- Daylighting/design intent may be affected

**Baseplate Orientation**:
- Specific requirement: "North baseplate to face westward"
- Located "below steel stud wall"
- Potential conflict with wall framing/services if not coordinated early

**Height Determination**:
- South angle specified as "full height required by shutter"
- Height not specified in PCN - dependent on shop drawings
- Risk of premature fabrication/installation

**Wall Cavity Depth**:
- HSS 76×76mm (approx 3") plus baseplate (½") = 3½" minimum depth required
- Standard steel stud walls may need upsizing to accommodate
- Gypsum board finish adds additional depth requirement

### 4.3 Sequencing Concerns

**Shop Drawing Dependency**:
- Structure must align with roller shutter shop drawings
- Shop drawings not yet finalized (referenced as SD# 049 R1)
- Risk of RFI/rework if structural installed before shop drawing approval

**Multi-Trade Coordination**:
- Structural steel installation
- Concrete anchor installation (Hilti system)
- Steel stud framing
- Gypsum board finishing
- Rolling shutter installation
- Clear sequencing required

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### 5.1 Structural Anchoring

**Hilti Hit-Hy 200 System**:
- Specified anchor system is an engineered product
- 4" embedment depth indicates concrete substrate requirements
- Manufacturer's installation procedures must be followed
- ICC-ES evaluation report compliance likely required
- Substrate condition and strength verification required prior to installation

### 5.2 Welding Requirements

**L102×102×4.8 to HSS Column**:
- Welding to existing structural column
- May require certified welder
- Weld specifications not detailed in PCN (should reference structural standards)
- Hot work permit likely required
- Potential impact on building occupancy/fire watch requirements

### 5.3 Slip Connection Design

**Connection to Beam Above**:
- Allows vertical movement/thermal expansion
- Engineering calculations required for load transfer
- Connection detail not fully shown in PCN
- Should be detailed in structural drawings or shop drawings

### 5.4 General Code Considerations

**Security Grilles**:
- Pharmacy security requirements per local regulations
- Emergency egress considerations (if grille blocks exit path)
- Fire separation compliance (if crossing fire-rated assemblies)
- Life safety code compliance for locking/release mechanisms

**Authority Approval**:
- PCN states: "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- Building official review may be required
- Structural calculations may need professional engineer seal

## 6. Technical Analysis

### 6.1 Load Path Assessment

**South Support (Welded Angle)**:
- L102×102×4.8 provides rigid lateral restraint
- Full-height installation creates continuous support
- Welded connection transfers shear to existing column
- Column south of GL E must be verified for additional loading

**North Support (HSS with Baseplate)**:
- HSS 76×76×6.4 provides vertical and lateral capacity
- Slip connection accommodates differential movement
- Two ¾" anchors resist overturning and shear
- Baseplate distributes loads to concrete substrate

### 6.2 Material Specifications

**Steel Grade** (not specified - typical assumption):
- HSS: ASTM A500 Grade C or CSA G40.21 350W
- Angle: ASTM A36 or CSA G40.21 300W
- Baseplate: ASTM A36
- Verification required from structural drawings

**Anchor System**:
- Hilti Hit-Hy 200: Two-component epoxy adhesive
- Suitable for high-load applications
- Temperature and substrate condition sensitive during installation

### 6.3 Dimensional Adequacy

**Baseplate Size (½" × 3½" × 12")**:
- Area: 42 sq. inches
- Conservative for two ¾" anchors
- 12" length provides stability against overturning
- 3½" width matches HSS 76mm (~3") dimension appropriately

**HSS Selection**:
- 76×76×6.4 is medium-duty section
- 6.4mm wall provides good local buckling resistance
- Slip connection reduces moment transfer, appropriate for sizing

## 7. Construction Considerations

### 7.1 Installation Sequence

Recommended order:
1. Verify existing conditions (column location, beam elevation, concrete strength)
2. Obtain and review roller shutter shop drawings
3. Coordinate structural component locations with architectural framing
4. Install north baseplate and anchors (allow adhesive cure time per manufacturer)
5. Install north HSS column with slip connection
6. Weld south angle to existing HSS column
7. Frame steel studs/wood blocking around supports
8. Install roller shutter system
9. Apply gypsum board finishes

### 7.2 Quality Control Points

- Verify concrete compressive strength before anchor installation
- Confirm anchor embedment depth (4" minimum)
- Verify weld quality and compliance with AWS standards
- Check plumb of HSS column
- Verify clearances for roller shutter installation
- Confirm gypsum board finish matches décor requirements

### 7.3 Procurement Lead Times

- HSS and angle steel: 1-2 weeks (standard sections)
- Baseplate fabrication: 1 week
- Hilti Hit-Hy 200 adhesive: Readily available
- Coordination with roller shutter supplier: Variable (critical path item)

## 8. Cost Impact Factors

### 8.1 Direct Costs

- Steel material (HSS, angle, baseplate)
- Welding labor and certification
- Anchor materials and installation
- Steel stud framing modifications
- Gypsum board and finishing
- Engineering review/calculations

### 8.2 Indirect Costs

- Window W12 resizing (if required)
- Coordination time and RFIs
- Potential rework if shop drawings change
- Schedule delay risk if not properly coordinated

## 9. Design Continuation Items

**Instigation**: Design Continuation (per PCN header)

This indicates:
- Original design documents incomplete for this condition
- Rolling shutter supports not detailed in original construction documents
- Design team developing details as construction progresses
- Potential for additional related PCNs

**Recommended Actions**:
- Request complete structural calculations for supports
- Obtain full-scale detail drawings showing all connections
- Verify coordination with all affected trades before proceeding
- Ensure roller shutter supplier provides certified shop drawings
