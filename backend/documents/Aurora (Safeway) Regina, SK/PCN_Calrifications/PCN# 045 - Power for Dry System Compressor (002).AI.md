## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Issues

#### 1. Circuit Capacity Verification Required
- **Issue**: Existing 15A-1P circuit breaker in Panel 'C1' must be verified as available
- **Risk**: Circuit may already be loaded or reserved for other equipment
- **Recommendation**: Confirm panel schedule shows spare 15A-1P breaker
- **Action Required**: Verify electrical load calculations account for 12.4A compressor load

#### 2. Distance Between Rooms
- **Issue**: Power must be routed from Compressor Room 300 to Sprinkler Room 194
- **Risk**: Long wire runs may cause voltage drop
- **Concern**: Manufacturer specifically warns about low voltage damage to motor
- **Recommendation**: Calculate voltage drop for actual wire run distance
- **Mitigation**: Use appropriate wire gauge to minimize voltage drop (consider upsizing from minimum #14 AWG)

#### 3. Extension Cord Warning
- **Issue**: Manufacturer strongly discourages use of extension cords
- **Permanent Installation**: This is a permanent installation, not temporary
- **Recommendation**: Hard-wire connection with dedicated circuit preferred
- **Alternative**: If extension cord necessary, must comply with amperage/length table

#### 4. Room Coordination
- **Sprinkler Room 194**: Verify adequate space for compressor installation
  - Requires 12" minimum clearance from walls
  - Needs well-ventilated area
  - Must accommodate air filter clearance
- **Compressor Room 300**: Verify Panel 'C1' accessibility for new connection

#### 5. Grounding Path Verification
- **Issue**: Grounding must be verified from Panel 'C1' to Sprinkler Room 194
- **Requirement**: Proper equipment grounding conductor required
- **Code Compliance**: Must meet local electrical code requirements

#### 6. Maintenance Access
- **Issue**: Daily draining of condensate required
- **Issue**: Oil changes required every 300 hours or 3 months
- **Concern**: Sprinkler Room 194 must provide adequate access for maintenance
- **Recommendation**: Verify maintenance clearances and condensate disposal method

#### 7. Piping Coordination
- **Warning**: Manufacturer prohibits plastic or PVC pipe for air distribution
- **Requirement**: Only metal pipe permitted
- **Coordination**: Verify sprinkler system piping does not conflict with air line routing
- **Freeze Protection**: If underground lines needed, must be below frost line

#### 8. Ambient Conditions
- **Temperature**: Room temperature affects required oil viscosity
- **Humidity**: High humidity requires air filter on outlet
- **Ventilation**: Must not operate in flammable vapor atmosphere
- **Coordination**: Verify Sprinkler Room 194 environmental conditions

## CONCLUSION

This PCN requires installation of a 120V, 12.4A air compressor for the dry sprinkler system. While the electrical load is modest (within 15A circuit capacity), several coordination and code compliance issues must be addressed:

1. **Circuit verification** is critical
2. **Voltage drop** calculations essential given equipment sensitivity
3. **Grounding and location classification** (wet/damp) must be confirmed
4. **Daily maintenance access** and condensate disposal must be planned
5. **Fire-stopping** and **proper ventilation** required
6. **Saskatchewan electrical permit** and **inspection** mandatory

The manufacturer's manual provides comprehensive safety warnings that must be incorporated into installation and O&M procedures. The automatic restart feature and daily drainage requirement are particularly critical for safe operation.

**Recommendation**: Approve PCN with conditions that electrical calculations, permit, and inspection be completed, and maintenance procedures established before commissioning.
