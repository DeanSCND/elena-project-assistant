# PCN# 024 - Canopy Overhang - Technical Data

**Document Type**: Proposed Change Notice (PCN)
**Project**: Aurora Food Store, 2000 Anaquod Road, Regina, SK
**Commission No.**: 2445
**PCN Number**: 024 (Structural PCN S1)
**Date Issued**: July 17, 2025 (Structural PCN dated July 11, 2025)
**Pages**: 5
**Analysis Generated**: 2026-01-09

## Executive Summary

This PCN addresses a coordination issue between structural and architectural elements at the high parapet/canopy overhang. The structural steel overhang extends approximately 16" beyond the exterior ACM (Aluminum Composite Material) cladding, creating an excessive and architecturally unacceptable projection. The resolution requires cutting back steel deck and supports to align with architectural intent and making structural repairs to maintain system integrity.

**Primary Issue**: Structural steel overhang at Grid Line F extends 3'-5" from gridline, while architectural ACM wall is only 1'-1.5" from gridline, resulting in ~16" excessive overhang.

**Resolution**: Cut steel deck and supports back to suit architectural details and repair/reinforce remaining structure per engineering specifications.

## 4. Identified Conflicts

### Primary Conflict: Structural vs. Architectural Coordination

**Nature of Conflict**:
- Structural steel design shows canopy overhang extending 3'-5" beyond Grid Line F
- Architectural design shows exterior ACM wall face at 1'-1.5" beyond Grid Line F
- Results in structural steel protruding approximately 16" beyond finished exterior wall

**Impact**:
- Aesthetically unacceptable - exposed structural steel beyond building envelope
- Weather protection issues - steel deck exposed beyond wall protection
- Potential for water infiltration at connection
- Does not match design intent shown in architectural elevations

### Secondary Conflict: Design Coordination Issue

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Structural drawings (S2.4/5) show full extension of steel framing to accommodate loads
- Architectural sections (A5.0/3) show reduced wall projection for aesthetic reasons
- Lack of coordination between disciplines during design phase
- Issue discovered during construction when steel was already fabricated/installed

**Timing Issues**:
- Steel likely already fabricated and installed before conflict identified
- RFI submitted July 9, 2025, suggesting issue found during field review
- Requires field modification rather than design correction

### Construction Sequencing Conflict

**Observed Issues**:
- Photos show steel structure already erected
- Modification requires cutting back installed steel members
- Light gauge framing and ACM installation cannot proceed until steel is corrected
- Potential schedule delay for cutting and reinforcing operations

### Structural Integrity Considerations

**Potential Concerns**:
1. **Load Path Modification**:
   - Cutting back steel deck reduces lateral diaphragm area
   - May affect load transfer to vertical elements
   - Engineer has provided reinforcement detail to address

2. **Connection Adequacy**:
   - New trimmed edge requires continuous support track
   - Additional fasteners specified (Kwik Flex and Hilti SDS screws)
   - Edge condition requires careful execution

3. **Cantilever Reduction**:
   - Reducing overhang affects moment conditions at support
   - Original HSS sizing may have accounted for longer cantilever
   - Engineer's detail suggests existing HSS adequate after modification

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Structural Code References

**Load Requirements**:
- Design Live Load: 4.8 kPa (100 psf) - Typical roof live load for accessible areas
- Design Dead Load: 3.6 kPa (75 psf) - Includes steel deck, insulation, finishes, MEP
- Loads appear to comply with NBCC (National Building Code of Canada)

**Connection Requirements**:
- Moment connections specified with explicit values (M = 30 kNm, Torsion 25 kNm)
- Splices to provide full moment and torsion capacity
- Indicates compliance with CSA S16 (Steel Structures standard)

### Fastener Specifications

**Compliance Notes**:
- Hilti #12 SDS screws specified at 12" O.C. - Standard spacing for steel deck attachment
- 1/4-20 Kwik Flex fasteners - Proprietary fastener for steel-to-steel connections
- Fastener specification suggests engineer has reviewed for pullout and shear capacity

### Steel Specifications

**Material Compliance**:
- HSS sections specified per Canadian standards (metric sizing)
- 20 Ga. deck is standard gauge for non-composite roof decks
- 18 Ga. track provides adequate edge support for trimmed deck

### Professional Seal Requirements

**Documentation**:
- Resolution signed by Charles Koop, P.Eng. (Professional Engineer)
- Digital signature dated July 14, 2025 (20250714)
- Indicates engineering review and approval per provincial regulations
- Saskatchewan and Manitoba have reciprocal engineering licenses

### Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

**Process Notes**:
- PCN states "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- No work to proceed before Change Order issued
- Indicates permit/building official review required before execution
- Modification must be submitted to City of Regina Building Department

### Construction Safety

**Implied Requirements**:
- Cutting operations require fall protection (work at +131' elevation)
- Hot work permit likely required for cutting steel
- Temporary bracing may be required during modification
- OSHA/CSA Z271 compliance for work at heights

### Quality Assurance

**Inspection Requirements**:
- Engineer's detail requires specific fastener types and spacing
- Field verification of modifications required
- Special inspection likely required for structural modifications
- Documentation of as-built conditions necessary for close-out

### Weather Exposure

**Building Envelope Considerations**:
- Modified edge condition must maintain weather-tightness
- Continuous track provides edge closure
- Interface with light gauge framing and ACM must be detailed
- Potential for thermal bridging at steel-to-steel connection

---

## 6. Technical Analysis

### Modification Procedure

**Step 1: Layout and Protection**:
- Survey and mark Grid Line F location on installed steel
- Establish cut line per architectural requirements (1'-1.5" beyond Grid F)
- Install temporary bracing if required
- Protect areas below from falling debris

**Step 2: Cutting Operations**:
- Cut steel deck back to suit architectural wall location
- Cut or modify HSS support members as required
- Maintain structural stability during cutting
- Remove cut sections safely

**Step 3: Edge Reinforcement**:
- Install continuous 4" x 18Ga. steel track with 2" flange
- Fasten track to HSS with 1/4-20 Kwik Flex fasteners from above and below
- Trim deck to allow track to fit between deck and HSS
- Fasten deck to track with Hilti #12 SDS screws at 12" O.C.

**Step 4: Verification**:
- Verify all fasteners installed per specification
- Check alignment with architectural wall location
- Photograph completed work for record
- Obtain engineer/inspector approval

### Load Transfer Mechanism

**Original Design**:
- Steel deck spans to HSS outriggers
- Load transfers through deck diaphragm to structural frame
- Cantilever overhang beyond Grid F

**Modified Design**:
- Reduced deck cantilever
- Continuous edge track supports trimmed deck edge
- Track fastened to HSS distributes loads
- Deck fastened to track maintains diaphragm action

### Structural Adequacy

**Engineer's Intent**:
- Modification detail provided by P.Eng. indicates structural adequacy reviewed
- HSS members sized for actual loads, not overhang length
- Edge track provides adequate support for reduced deck span
- Fastener schedule maintains load transfer capacity
