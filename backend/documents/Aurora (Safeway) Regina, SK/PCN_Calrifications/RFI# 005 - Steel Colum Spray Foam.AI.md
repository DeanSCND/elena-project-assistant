## 3. Cross-References

### Referenced Drawings
- **A5.0 to A5.3**: Wall section drawings (show spray foam installed in most exterior girts and open cavities)
- **A6.0**: Plan details drawings (do not show any columns filled with spray foam)

### Related Documents
- Architectural wall sections (A5 series)
- Architectural plan details (A6 series)

### Document Relationships
This RFI creates a critical link between:
1. Wall section details (A5.0-A5.3)
2. Plan view details (A6.0)
3. Insulation/spray foam installation specifications

## 4. Identified Conflicts

### Primary Conflict
**Discrepancy between drawing sets regarding spray foam in steel columns:**

- **A5 Series (Wall Sections)**: Shows spray foam installed in most exterior girts and open cavities
- **A6 Series (Plan Details)**: Does NOT show any columns filled with spray foam

### Specific Issue Statement
The contractor (Quorex) is requesting confirmation that there are no columns on this project that require spray foam filling, despite spray foam being shown in other exterior cavities on the wall sections.

### Coordination Concerns
1. **Scope Ambiguity**: Unclear whether steel columns require spray foam insulation
2. **Specification Gap**: Wall sections show foam in "open cavities" but plan details omit column treatment
3. **Thermal Performance**: Potential thermal bridging if columns are not insulated when adjacent cavities are
4. **Fire Rating**: Possible fire protection implications if columns are exposed steel
5. **Cost Impact**: Significant cost difference depending on spray foam scope

### Construction Impact
- **Schedule**: Awaiting response marked "As Soon As Possible"
- **Installation Sequence**: Spray foam installation timing depends on clarification
- **Material Procurement**: Foam quantity and application scope uncertain
- **Coordination**: Steel erection, exterior wall assembly, and insulation trades all affected

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Potential Code Considerations

#### Energy Code Compliance
- **Thermal Bridging**: Steel columns can create significant thermal bridges in building envelope
- **Continuous Insulation**: Modern energy codes typically require continuous insulation or thermal break strategies
- **Saskatchewan Energy Code**: May have specific requirements for steel column insulation in conditioned spaces

#### Fire Protection
- **Exposed Steel**: Uninsulated steel columns may require fire protection depending on:
  - Building occupancy classification (retail/food store)
  - Required fire resistance rating
  - Structural fire protection requirements
- **Spray Foam Fire Rating**: If used for fire protection, spray foam must meet required ratings

#### Building Envelope
- **Air Barrier Continuity**: Columns penetrating building envelope require proper air sealing
- **Vapor Barrier**: Spray foam can serve as air and vapor barrier if applied correctly
- **Condensation Control**: Uninsulated columns in insulated walls can cause condensation issues

### Compliance Questions Raised
1. Does the building envelope design account for thermal bridging at columns?
2. Are steel columns required to have fire protection?
3. Does the energy model assume insulated or uninsulated columns?
4. What is the intended air barrier strategy at column locations?

## 6. Technical Analysis

### Construction Considerations

#### If Columns ARE to be Spray Foamed:
- Requires coordination with steel erection
- May need temporary protection during welding
- Application access and coverage verification needed
- Thickness specification required
- Fire rating verification if applicable

#### If Columns ARE NOT to be Spray Foamed:
- Alternative thermal break strategy needed
- Potential detail at column/wall intersection
- May require supplementary insulation wrapping
- Air sealing detail required at penetrations

### Cost Implications
- Steel column spray foam can represent significant material and labor cost
- Number of columns not specified in RFI
- Impact on overall insulation budget unclear

---

## 7. Recommended Actions

### For Design Team (Nejmark Architect):
1. Review energy calculations and thermal bridging assumptions
2. Verify fire protection requirements for exposed steel
3. Check original design intent for column insulation
4. Issue clear written response with:
   - Confirmation of column spray foam requirement (yes/no)
   - If yes: thickness, coverage limits, and fire rating requirements
   - Updated detail drawings if necessary
5. Consider issuing Construction Order (C.O.) if scope changes

### For Contractor (Quorex):
1. Document response and distribute to trades
2. Adjust insulation scope and pricing accordingly
3. Coordinate steel and insulation schedules
4. Verify fire protection requirements with authority having jurisdiction
5. Update shop drawings to reflect clarification

## 10. Critical Notes

### Typo Alert
- Document title contains typo: "Steel Colum" should be "Steel Column"

### Urgency
- Response requested "As Soon As Possible"
- Likely on critical path for construction schedule
- May impact multiple trades and sequences

### Scope Impact
- This clarification could significantly affect project cost and schedule
- May require design team to revisit building envelope strategy
- Could trigger change order if original intent was unclear
