- **Backbone Cabling:** Fiber or copper interconnection
- **Switch Configuration:** Network switch specifications
- **VLAN Configuration:** Network segmentation requirements
- **Power Backup:** UPS requirements and sizing

### Physical Installation:
- **Wall Backing:** Ensure adequate backing for rack mounting (wall-mount rack heavy when loaded)
- **Height Coordination:** "High level" - coordinate exact mounting height
- **Leveling:** Rack must be perfectly vertical and level
- **Cable Entry:** Provide pathway for cables into rack (top or bottom feed)
- **Ventilation:** Adequate airflow for equipment cooling

**Sequence Dependencies:**
1. Coordinate with Sobeys I.T. Department for exact requirements
2. Determine rack type (wall-mount vs. floor-stand)
3. Verify wall construction suitable for rack mounting
4. Install backing/blocking if required
5. Route power circuit O-45 from Panel O to Room 112

16. Configure network switch
17. Label all ports, cables, and circuits
18. Commission system
19. Update as-built drawings

**Critical Coordination Points:**

### Sobeys I.T. Department:
**CRITICAL:** Drawing Note 35 states "CONFIRM EXACT REQUIREMENTS WITH SOBEYS I.T. DEPARTMENT"

This means:
- Rack specifications not fully defined at PCN issuance
- Equipment list to be provided by Sobeys I.T.
- Network configuration determined by corporate standards
- May include specific switch models, UPS requirements
- Security requirements may apply
- Remote management capabilities may be required

**Typical Sobeys Requirements may include:**
- Specific network switch models (Cisco, HP, etc.)
- VLAN configuration for POS, back office, WiFi
- Connection to corporate WAN
- Security appliances
- Network monitoring
- Backup power (UPS) with runtime requirements

### High Level Mounting:
"At high level" typically means:
- Receptacle mounting: 6-7 feet above floor
- Keeps equipment above desk height
- Provides security (harder to access)
- Cable management easier
- Aesthetic - less visible from normal sight lines
- Typical for data rooms and network closets

### Data Outlet Reconfiguration:
Change from 3 wall outlets to 2 duplex rack outlets represents:
- **Centralization:** All data in one location vs. distributed
- **Port Count:** 3-6 ports reduced to 4 ports (2 duplex)
  - May represent consolidation or actual port reduction
  - Or original 3 may have been 3 × single-port = 3 ports total
  - New 2 duplex = 4 ports (actually an increase if original were single-port)
- **Rack Integration:** Professional appearance, better organization
- **Flexibility:** Easier to add switch ports than wall outlets

### T-Slot Receptacle Requirement:
Using T-slot (5-20R) instead of standard (5-15R) indicates:
- Equipment may draw close to 20A
- Allows flexibility for higher-draw equipment
- Common for IT/network applications
- Future-proofs installation

**Manufacturer/Supplier Coordination:**

**Data/Communications:**
- Convergint specified as preferred data cabling provider (per E5.0 notes)
- Contact: Shawn Smith (403-860-5036)
- Location: Calgary, Alberta

**Rack and Equipment:**
- Specifications to come from Sobeys I.T. Department
- Likely corporate-standard equipment

## 7. COST/SCHEDULE IMPACT

**Cost Impact:**

- Coordination with store manager office furniture installation

Contractor (Quorex Construction Services Ltd.) required to submit signed letter with:
- Price including cost breakdown
- Any change to construction schedule

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Network Rack in Store Manager Office - Context:**

This configuration is somewhat unusual as network racks are typically located in:
1. **Primary:** Dedicated IT/data room (Room 114 in this case)
2. **Secondary:** Telecommunications closets
3. **Not typical:** Manager offices

**Possible reasons for Room 112 rack:**
- **Physical Proximity:** Room 112 adjacent to IT Room 114
- **Space Constraints:** IT Room 114 may be too small for all equipment
- **Network Topology:** Distribution switch for office area
- **Legacy Configuration:** Existing Sobeys store standard
- **Security:** Manager office provides controlled access
- **Dual-Purpose:** Room 112 may serve as secondary IT space

**Network Architecture (Inferred):**

**IT Room 114 (Main):**
- Main data room
- Core network switch
- Server equipment
- Primary UPS
- Telephone backboard
- Internet service entrance
- Main patch panel
- Circuits O-3,5,7,9 serve this room

**Store Manager Office 112 (Secondary):**
- Distribution switch for office wing
- Local patch panel for Room 112 data ports
- Reduces cable runs to IT Room 114
- May support office-specific services
- Circuit O-45 serves this rack

**Topology likely:**
Room 112 rack ←→ IT Room 114 main rack (fiber or copper trunk)
           ↓
    Office area devices

**Power Considerations:**

**20A Circuit Analysis:**
A 20A circuit at 120V provides 2,400VA maximum capacity.

**Typical equipment loads:**
- 24-port network switch: 30-150W (0.25-1.25A)
- Small UPS: 500-1000VA (4-8A typical)
- Patch panel: No power
- Cable management: No power
- **Total estimated:** 4-10A peak

**This indicates:**
- Single 20A circuit adequate for typical configuration
- May need second circuit if large UPS specified
- T-slot (20A) receptacle appropriate

**Data Port Count Analysis:**

**Original:** 3 data outlets
- If single-port: 3 total ports
- If duplex: 6 total ports
- Likely: 3 single-port outlets

**Revised:** 2 duplex data receptacles
- 4 total RJ45 ports minimum
- Mounted in/near rack
- Professional appearance

**Port usage (typical):**
1. Store manager workstation
2. Office printer/MFP
3. IP phone
4. Additional workstation or device
5. Spare for future use

**Alternate interpretation:**
- "2 duplex receptacles" could mean 2 sets of duplex faceplates
- This would provide 8 ports total (4 ports × 2)
- More likely than 4 ports given typical office needs

**Category 6 vs. Category 6A:**
- **Cat 6:** 1 Gbps to 100m, 10 Gbps to 55m
- **Cat 6A:** 10 Gbps to 100m
- Sobeys likely specifies Cat 6 minimum
- Cat 6A future-proofs for 10 Gbps

**T-Slot Receptacle Detail:**

NEMA 5-20R configuration:
```
    ___
   |   |   ← Neutral (straight slot)
   |___|
    ___
   |   |   ← Hot (T-shaped slot - accepts 15A or 20A plug)
   |_T_|
    ___
   ( o )   ← Ground (round)
    ‾‾‾
```

The "T" allows insertion of 20A plug (horizontal blade) while maintaining compatibility with standard 15A plugs.

**Revision History Analysis:**

Multiple PCNs issued in late December 2025:
- PCN-30 through PCN-33 (all dated 2025.12.23)
- PCN-34 (this PCN) dated 2026.01.06

This indicates:
- Heavy design activity in December 2025
- Possible value engineering exercise
- Late changes as construction progresses
- Final refinements before store opening
- This PCN (#063) is relatively late in construction

**Fire Protection Considerations:**
- Ensure rack doesn't block smoke detectors
- Don't mount rack over fire alarm pull station
- Maintain clearances to sprinkler heads
- Network equipment contains plastics (fire load)
- Proper ventilation prevents overheating

**Security Considerations:**
- Store manager office provides controlled access
- Rack may require locking door
- Physical security for network infrastructure
- Prevent unauthorized access to network equipment
- Consider camera coverage

**Code Compliance:**
- **CEC (Canadian Electrical Code):** Electrical installation
- **TIA-568:** Commercial cabling standards
- **TIA-569:** Commercial building pathways and spaces
- **BICSI Standards:** Data cabling best practices
- **Building Code:** Fire protection, accessibility

**Maintenance and Operations:**

**Access Requirements:**
- Store manager must understand equipment function
- Access for IT personnel (may need key/code)
- Adequate space in front of rack for maintenance
- Labeling must be clear and comprehensive

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- Network equipment firmware updates
- UPS battery replacement (typically 3-5 years)
- Dust cleaning (especially important for switches)
- Cable management maintenance
- Port documentation updates

**Documentation Required:**
- As-built drawings with circuit O-45 routing
- Panel O schedule updated
- Network diagram showing Room 112 rack
- Port mapping documentation
- Equipment serial numbers and warranties
- IP address assignments
- VLAN configuration
- User manuals for all equipment

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW RISK** - Standard electrical/data work
- **COORDINATION RISK** - Requires Sobeys I.T. input
- **SCHEDULE RISK** - Low, office area not critical path
- **COST VARIABILITY** - Medium to high depending on equipment specs
- **FUNCTIONAL RISK** - Low if properly designed and installed
