## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Critical Coordination Item
**Issue**: Storm line connection size/location requires coordination with Landlord's civil scope
**Responsibility**: Quorex Construction Services Ltd.
**Impact**: Connection point must align with civil/site drainage infrastructure
**Risk**: Potential for size mismatch or location conflict if not properly coordinated

### Sequential Sizing Strategy
**Concern**: Multiple pipe upsize transitions (6" → 10" → 12")
**Benefit**: Cost reduction through minimized 12" pipe length
**Risk**: Additional fittings and transitions increase potential leak points
**Recommendation**: Ensure proper reducer/increaser fittings specified and gradual transitions maintained

### Keynote Modification
**Item**: Keynote #4 previously referenced different storm sewer size
**Change**: Now specifies 12" diameter
**Impact**: All references to Keynote #4 throughout drawing set must be verified for consistency

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Approval Process
- **PCN Requirement**: Change Order must be issued before work proceeds
- **AHJ Review**: Authority Having Jurisdiction must review and advise of objections
- **Contractor Submittal**: Signed letter with pricing and schedule impact required

### Drainage System Requirements
- Progressive pipe upsizing strategy (6" → 10" → 12") suggests adherence to velocity and capacity requirements
- Trench drains (TD-2) at building perimeter suggest loading dock or service area drainage
- Multiple drain types (FD, AD, TD) indicate comprehensive floor drainage system per plumbing code

### Potential Code Considerations
- **Cleanout Access**: Multiple pipe size transitions may require cleanouts per plumbing code
- **Slope Requirements**: Storm piping must maintain minimum slope (typically 1/4" per foot minimum)
- **Backflow Prevention**: Connection to landlord's system may require backwater valve
- **Structural**: 12" pipe penetrations require coordination with structural foundations

## 6. Technical Specifications Summary

### Storm Drainage System Modifications

**Component**: Trench Drain Outlets
**Size**: 6" outlets (no change)
**Acceptance**: Confirmed acceptable by engineer

**Component**: Combined Trench Drain Line
**Size**: 10" diameter
**Location**: Combination point after trench drains
**Responsibility**: Mechanical Contractor to upsize from 6" to 10"

**Component**: Storm Service Connection
**Size**: 12" diameter
**Location**: Near building exterior connection to landlord's system
**Responsibility**: Mechanical Contractor to upsize from 10" to 12"
**Rationale**: Minimize 12" pipe length to reduce material costs

## 7. Action Items & Requirements

### Contractor Actions Required

1. **Pricing Submittal**:
   - Submit signed letter with cost breakdown
   - Include schedule impact analysis
   - Await Change Order before proceeding

2. **Coordination**:
   - Coordinate storm line connection with Landlord's civil contractor
   - Verify connection location and size compatibility
   - Confirm invert elevations match

3. **Material Procurement**:
   - Order pipe reducers/increasers for 6" to 10" transition
   - Order pipe reducers/increasers for 10" to 12" transition
   - Confirm 12" storm pipe material specification

4. **Drawing Updates**:
   - Verify Keynote #4 modification on drawing M1.1
   - Update shop drawings to reflect revised pipe sizing
   - Confirm all affected details and sections updated

### Designer/Engineer Actions

1. **Drawing Revision**:
   - Issue revised M1.1 with modified Keynote #4
   - Update pipe sizing on plan view
   - Add details for pipe size transitions if not already shown

2. **Specification Review**:
   - Confirm pipe material specifications adequate for 12" size
   - Verify bedding and backfill requirements for larger pipe
   - Review structural implications of 12" penetrations

## 8. Cost Impact Considerations

**Material Cost Reduction**: Upsizing to 12" only near service connection minimizes expensive larger diameter pipe
**Labor Impact**: Additional fittings for transitions increase installation labor
**Schedule Impact**: Contractor to advise of any delays due to material lead times
**Value Engineering**: Change appears to be cost-saving measure while maintaining performance

---

## 9. Potential Questions & Clarifications Needed

1. **Transition Locations**: Where exactly do the 6"→10" and 10"→12" transitions occur? Distances from drains?
2. **Fitting Types**: Are reducers, increasers, or eccentric reducers specified for transitions?
3. **Cleanout Requirements**: Are cleanouts required at size transition points per local code?
4. **Invert Elevations**: What are the invert elevations at connection point to match landlord's system?
5. **Pipe Material**: Is material consistent across all sizes (PVC, HDPE, etc.)?
6. **Backwater Valve**: Is a backwater valve required at the service connection?
7. **Original Design**: What was the original keynote #4 specification being replaced?
