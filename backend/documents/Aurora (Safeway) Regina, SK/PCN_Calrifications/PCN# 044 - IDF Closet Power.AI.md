## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Height Coordination Issue - CRITICAL**
- IDF Cabinet mounted at 9'-0" AFF
- Bulkhead shown at 8'-6" (TYP) in the general area
- **CONFLICT**: If bulkhead extends over the manager's desk area, there is only 6" clearance between bulkhead and IDF cabinet mounting height
- **RISK**: Insufficient space for IDF cabinet installation and cable management
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify bulkhead location relative to manager's desk and confirm clearances

**2. Furniture vs. Equipment Coordination**
- IDF cabinet to be mounted "above Manager's Desk"
- No indication of desk dimensions or depth
- **CONCERN**: Cable drops and power connections will be visible and must route through/around desk area
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Coordinate exact desk placement and depth to ensure adequate access to IDF cabinet

**3. Power/Data Routing**
- PCN states "Relocate all electrical for IDF Data cabinet"
- No routing path shown on available floor plan
- Distance from electrical room appears significant
- **CONCERN**: Conduit routing path not defined, may conflict with architectural elements
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Develop routing plan from electrical room to new location

**4. End-User IT Confirmation Required**
- PCN Note 1 explicitly states: "Confirm exact requirements with end-user's I.T. group"
- **STATUS**: Confirmation requirement noted but completion not documented
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Obtain written confirmation from Sobeys IT department

**5. Accessibility Concerns**
- Cabinet mounted at 9'-0" AFF requires ladder access for maintenance
- Located above occupied desk workspace
- **CONCERN**: Service disruption to manager during maintenance activities
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Confirm acceptable to end-user operations

**6. Pallet Storage Proximity**
- IDF location is adjacent to 12-pallet storage area
- **CONCERN**: Potential for impact damage during pallet movement
- **CONCERN**: Dust and debris from storage operations
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Consider protective measures or location adjustment

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Electrical Code Considerations

**1. Working Space Requirements (CEC Section 2)**
- IDF cabinet at 9'-0" AFF may require adequate working space in front
- Desk below creates potential access obstruction
- **CODE REFERENCE**: CEC 2-308 (Working Space About Electrical Equipment)
- **VERIFICATION NEEDED**: Confirm clearances meet code requirements for data equipment

**2. Equipment Support**
- Wall-mounted equipment at 9'-0" height requires structural support verification
- **CODE REFERENCE**: CEC 12-3034 (Support of Equipment)
- **VERIFICATION NEEDED**: Structural adequacy of wall for IDF cabinet weight

**3. Cable Management**
- Vertical cable routing from 9'-0" height to floor level
- **CODE REFERENCE**: CEC 12-2202 (Support of Communications Cables)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Proper cable support and protection required

**4. Grounding and Bonding**
- IDF cabinet relocation requires grounding system extension
- **CODE REFERENCE**: CEC Section 10 (Grounding and Bonding)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Verify grounding electrode conductor routing and sizing

**5. Fire Stopping**
- Cable penetrations through fire-rated assemblies
- **CODE REFERENCE**: NBC 3.1.9 (Fire Stopping)
- **REQUIREMENT**: All penetrations must maintain fire rating of assembly

### Accessibility Code Considerations

**1. Reach Ranges**
- Equipment mounted at 9'-0" AFF exceeds accessible reach ranges
- **CODE REFERENCE**: NBC 3.8.3.3 (Reach Ranges)
- **JUSTIFICATION**: May be acceptable for service equipment not intended for regular user operation
- **VERIFICATION NEEDED**: Confirm equipment type classification with AHJ

**2. Protruding Objects**
- Wall-mounted cabinet may create protruding object hazard
- **CODE REFERENCE**: NBC 3.8.3.5 (Protruding Objects)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Verify cabinet does not project into circulation path or verify adequate cane-detection

### Building Code Considerations

**1. Electrical Room Requirements**
- Original location in dedicated electrical room vs. new location in occupied office space
- **CONSIDERATION**: Verify if IDF cabinet requires dedicated/secured space
- **VERIFICATION NEEDED**: Confirm with building official if location change affects room classification

## 11. MISSING INFORMATION

### Visual Documentation Gaps
- PCN cover sheet header image (page001_img001.jpeg) - not available for review
- Professional signature/stamp image (page001_img002.png) - not available for review
- Electrical diagram/detail (page002_img001.png) - **CRITICAL** - not available for review
- Electrical PCN header (page002_img002.jpeg) - not available for review

### Technical Information Gaps
- IDF cabinet physical dimensions (width, depth, height)
- IDF cabinet weight and loading requirements
- Specific power requirements (voltage, amperage, circuit quantity)

## 12. NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

1. **Relocation Rationale**: No justification provided for moving IDF from electrical room to office location - may be for improved access or space constraints

2. **"Rachelle Bery"**: Appears to be a branded department/section within the Aurora/Safeway store (possibly organic/natural foods section)

3. **Change Order Process**: PCN clearly states "No work is to be done before this matter is finalized and a 'Change Order' is issued"

4. **Dual PCN Numbers**: This change is documented as both architectural PCN #044 and electrical PCN #22, suggesting coordinated multi-discipline change

5. **Schedule Impact**: Contractor required to advise of any changes to construction schedule

6. **Cost Impact**: Contractor required to submit pricing with cost breakdown

7. **Wall Type Assumption**: Document assumes wall at GL F&G can support wall-mounted equipment - verification required

8. **Reference to HMR Equipment**: Electrical PCN subject line mentions "Revised Electrical for HMR Equipment" but body discusses IDF relocation - possible subject line error or related work

## 13. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
1. Extract and review missing electrical diagram (page002_img001.png) if possible
2. Initiate coordination meeting with Sobeys IT to confirm requirements
3. Request structural review of proposed wall mounting location
4. Develop detailed electrical routing plan

### Design Considerations
1. Consider cable management system design for clean appearance above desk
2. Evaluate if cabinet should be lockable/secured given office location
3. Consider future expansion requirements for IT infrastructure
4. Evaluate alternative locations if clearance conflicts cannot be resolved

### Documentation Improvements
1. Add IDF cabinet cut sheet to package
2. Include elevation detail showing cabinet, bulkhead, and desk relationships
3. Provide enlarged plan showing exact mounting location and clearances
4. Add installation sequence notes to coordinate with furniture installation
