## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Address Discrepancy

**CONFLICT IDENTIFIED**:
- Cover page lists project address as: **2000 Anaquod Road, Regina, SK**
- Technical page lists project address as: **4801 Optimist Drive, Regina, Saskatchewan**

**Resolution Required**: Verify correct project address with owner/contractor

### Design Change Rationale

**Potential Issues**:
- No explanation provided for why the supply diffuser is being deleted
- Possible implications:
  - Reduced air supply to Meat Prep area
  - Potential impact on room ventilation/temperature control
  - May affect health code compliance for food prep areas
  - Could impact odor control and air quality in meat preparation space

**Questions to Consider**:
- Is there alternative ventilation for the Meat Prep area?
- Was the original diffuser oversupplying the space?
- Is there a conflict with the insulated panel installation?
- Has this been coordinated with health/building officials?

### Coordination Concerns

**Insulated Panel Interface**:
- Specific instruction not to penetrate insulated panel
- Suggests potential conflict between HVAC duct penetration and wall panel system
- May indicate that this change is driven by panel installation conflicts

**Adjacent Spaces**:
- Impact on Meat Cooler 152 HVAC system (if integrated)
- Verify balanced air distribution for adjacent areas

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Ventilation Requirements

**Food Preparation Areas**:
- Meat preparation areas typically require specific ventilation rates per health codes
- Deletion of supply diffuser may impact:
  - Required air changes per hour (ACH)
  - Temperature control for food safety
  - Odor control and air quality
  - Negative/positive pressure relationships with adjacent spaces

**Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)**:
- Cover page notes: "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- AHJ review required before proceeding

### Building Code Considerations

**Mechanical Ventilation**:
- Verify compliance with local building code mechanical ventilation requirements
- Saskatchewan Building Code (SBC) requirements for food preparation areas
- National Building Code of Canada (NBC) referenced requirements

**Health Code**:
- Food establishment ventilation requirements
- Saskatchewan Health Authority regulations for meat preparation facilities
- Proper air quality for food safety operations

### Documentation Requirements

**Change Order Process**:
- "No work is to be done before this matter is finalized and a 'Change Order' is issued"
- Contractor must submit signed letter with:
  - Price (including cost breakdown)
  - Credit amount for deleted diffuser S2
  - Change to construction schedule (if any)

## 9. CRITICAL NOTES

**WARNING**: This PCN deletes a supply air diffuser from a food preparation area. Proper ventilation in meat preparation spaces is critical for:
- Food safety and temperature control
- Odor management
- Worker comfort
- Health code compliance

**Verification Required**: Confirm that deletion of this diffuser does not compromise:
- Required ventilation rates for the space
- Temperature control for meat preparation activities
- Health authority requirements
- Building code compliance

**Panel Coordination**: The specific note about not penetrating the insulated panel suggests this change may be driven by a coordination conflict between the HVAC duct penetration and the insulated wall panel system. This coordination issue should be documented and resolved.

**Address Verification**: Resolve the address discrepancy between cover page and technical page before finalizing documentation.
