## 4. Identified Conflicts & Issues

### Potential Coordination Issues

#### 1. **Voltage Compatibility Concern**
**Issue**: Conversion from 120V to 208V for defrost heaters requires verification that all connected equipment is rated for 208V operation.

**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Recommendation**: Verify all defrost heater elements are compatible with 208V operation or confirm they will be replaced with 208V-rated units.

#### 2. **Breaker Configuration Discrepancy**
**Issue**: PCN text states "five(5) 20A-3P breakers are removed" AND "five(5) 20A-3P breakers are added" - suggesting 20A circuits remain 3-pole while others change to 2-pole.

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Clarification Needed**: Confirm whether 20A breakers are intentionally remaining as 3-pole or if this is a documentation error.

#### 3. **Drawing Version Control**
**Issue**: PCN explicitly calls out use of LMP drawing R01 version dated 2025-02-04, NOT 2024-11-19. This suggests an earlier version exists that should NOT be used.

**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Action Required**: Ensure all contractors are working from the correct 2025-02-04 version to avoid installing wrong specifications.

#### 4. **Panel Loading and Phase Balance**
**Issue**: Converting from 3-pole to 2-pole breakers will affect phase balance in panels. Phase loading calculations should be verified.

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: Verify panel schedules show proper phase distribution and that no single phase is overloaded.

#### 5. **Existing vs. New Work Coordination**
**Issue**: PCN dated November 27, 2025, but drawing revision is dated November 25, 2025. Timing suggests work may be ongoing or imminent.

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Note**: Verify construction schedule to ensure modifications can be implemented without disrupting store opening timeline.

#### 6. **Heat Trace Circuit Protection**
**Issue**: Note 8 on E4.0 requires GFCI protection for heat trace circuits, while General Note 13 requires 30mA fixed-trip GFCI for all anti-sweat circuits.

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Clarification**: Confirm defrost heater circuits are separate from anti-sweat and heat trace requirements, or if GFCI protection also applies.

### Missing Information

1. **Load Calculations**: No panel load calculations shown to verify capacity with new 2-pole breaker configuration
2. **Existing Conditions**: No documentation of existing defrost heater types or ratings
3. **Equipment Cut Sheets**: LMP specifications table shows amperage but not wattage or specific heater models
4. **Phasing Diagram**: No indication of which phase legs the 2-pole breakers should connect to for proper balance
5. **Construction Schedule Impact**: No indication if this is pre-construction or a field change

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Canadian Electrical Code Compliance

#### General Requirements (from E4.0 General Notes)
1. **CEC Compliance**: All refrigeration conduits and wiring installations must comply with Canadian Electrical Code (General Note 7)

2. **Equipment Disconnects**: All motor starters must be complete with overcurrent protection (General Note 5)

3. **Roof Receptacles**: CEC 26-710 requires separate circuit weatherproof GFCI T-slot duplex receptacle mounted on roof next to all roof-mounted equipment for servicing (General Note 6)

4. **GFCI Protection**:
   - Heat trace circuits must be GFCI protected (Drawing Note 8)
   - All anti-sweat circuits require fixed-trip 30mA GFCI protection (General Note 13)

5. **Penetration Sealing**: Conduits must be sealed where passing through floors, exterior walls, ceilings, coolers, freezers, and meat rooms (General Note 6)

#### Circuit Protection Requirements

**Defrost Heater Circuits**:

- 20A-2P circuits: Suitable for loads up to 16A continuous
- 25A-2P circuits: Suitable for loads up to 20A continuous
- 30A-2P circuits: Suitable for loads up to 24A continuous

**Wire Sizing Verification**:
- #10 AWG copper at 75°C rating: 30A ampacity (suitable for 25A-30A breakers)
- Installation method and temperature corrections should be verified on-site

#### Voltage Requirements
**Transformation Compliance**:
- Converting from 120V/1Ø to 208V/1Ø requires equipment rated for higher voltage
- No step-down transformers indicated, suggesting equipment must be natively 208V capable
- Verify equipment nameplates match voltage specifications

#### Fire Safety Integration
**From Fire Alarm Notes** (E0.3):
1. Installation must meet CAN/ULC S524 standard
2. Fire alarm wiring for addressable loop must be Class 'A'
3. Minimum 60-minute backup capacity under full load required
4. High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) fans must interlock with fire alarm to shut down upon sprinkler activation
5. Equipment beneath NFPA-96 hoods must de-energize upon fire suppression system activation

**Refrigeration-Specific Safety**:
- No electrical installations allowed on cooler/freezer panels unless approved by engineer or Sobeys manager (General Note 11)
- All exposed conduits in open ceiling areas mounted close to underside of roof deck (General Note 5)

#### Grounding and Bonding
- While not explicitly detailed in these sheets, all equipment must be properly grounded per CEC requirements
- Three-wire circuits (hot-hot-ground) for 2-pole 208V circuits

#### Labeling and Identification
**Required per General Note 8**:
- Electrical contractor must provide proper identifications to each end of wires, cables, and conduits to suit each corresponding system
- Critical for multi-system refrigeration installation

#### Coordination Requirements
**Code-Related Coordination** (General Note 1-2):
- Work must be completed per schedule prior to store opening
- Coordinate with refrigeration contractor, equipment supplier, and owner's representative
- Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) must advise of any objections (PCN cover sheet)

## 6. Technical Analysis Summary

### Scope of Work
This PCN modifies electrical distribution for refrigeration defrost heaters across four main electrical panels. The fundamental change is converting defrost heater circuits from 3-pole to 2-pole breaker configurations to match revised voltage requirements (208V single-phase instead of 3-phase connection).

### System Impact
- **Equipment Affected**: All walk-in cooler and freezer defrost heater systems (AM-C and AL-C series)
- **Panel Count**: 4 panels modified (R1M, R2L, R3L, R4L)
- **Circuit Count**: Approximately 40+ defrost heater circuits modified
- **Associated Systems**: Evaporator panels (AM-E and AL-E series) also shown in schedules

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Field Verification Required**: Confirm existing heater voltage ratings before energizing
2. **Phasing Strategy**: Determine optimal phase distribution for 2-pole breakers to maintain panel balance
3. **Testing Protocol**: All defrost heater circuits should be tested at 208V before final commissioning
4. **Sequence**: This work likely needs completion before refrigeration equipment startup

### Quality Control Checkpoints
1. Verify LMP drawing R01 revision date (must be 2025-02-04)
2. Confirm all breakers changed from 3P to 2P as scheduled
3. Verify wire sizing adequate for new configuration
4. Test voltage at each heater location (should read 208V)
5. Confirm proper identification of all circuits
6. Verify phase balance across all modified panels
7. Obtain approval from Authority Having Jurisdiction
