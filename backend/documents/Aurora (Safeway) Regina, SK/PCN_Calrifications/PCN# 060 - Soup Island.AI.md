## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Circuit Numbering Discrepancy**
- **Issue**: PCN references circuit "46,48" but Panel H schedule shows circuits continuing beyond standard numbering
- **Observation**: Circuit 45/46 area appears to have space allocation; verify no overlap with adjacent circuits
- **Action Required**: Electrical contractor to verify panel capacity and circuit assignment before rough-in

**2. Power Requirements vs. Available Panel Capacity**
- **Concern**: Panel 'H' is 400A panel; verify sufficient capacity for additional 15A-2P circuit
- **Load Analysis Needed**: Confirm total connected load and demand load calculations
- **Recommendation**: Review Panel 'H' load calculations to ensure within NEC/CEC requirements

**3. Dual Power Supply Requirement**
- **Issue**: Equipment requires TWO separate power connections:
  - 208V-1PH NEMA 6-15 for cooler unit (H-21b)
  - 120V-1PH NEMA 5-15 (4 units) for heated soup wells (likely part of existing H-21 circuits)
- **Coordination**: Clarify if the 4 x 120V soup well circuits are NEW or use existing H-21 circuits
- **Drawing Ambiguity**: H-21 shown as "4 units" at 500W each (120V) - may be the heated wells
- **Action Required**: Confirm total circuit count: Is this 5 new circuits (1x208V + 4x120V) or just 1 new circuit (208V) with reuse of existing?

**4. Receptacle Location Coordination**
- **Issue**: Drawing E2.4 shows receptacle location but lacks precise mounting height
- **Equipment Constraint**: Soup island unit is 1695mm (66.75") tall with controller access at 893mm height
- **Action Required**: Coordinate with millwork, equipment supplier, and GC for:
  - Exact receptacle mounting location
  - Clearances for service access
  - Avoid interference with controller access drawer

**5. Equipment Model Reference Mismatch**
- **Observation**: Technical data references "RDEL-22 ELEGANT" but dimensional drawing shows "RDEL-33/35"
- **Clarification Needed**: Confirm actual equipment model number
- **Impact**: May affect final electrical specifications if model differs

**6. Soup Well Power Source**
- **Ambiguity**: Technical data shows 4 x NEMA 5-15 for soup wells (16.8A total)
- **Issue**: 16.8A exceeds single 15A circuit capacity
- **Resolution Required**: Confirm soup wells are on separate 15A circuits (likely 4 separate circuits, or 2 circuits with 2 wells each)
- **Panel Impact**: If new circuits required, additional panel capacity analysis needed

### Mechanical/Refrigeration Coordination

**1. Refrigerant Type (R290)**
- **Note**: R290 is propane - flammable refrigerant
- **Code Compliance**: Verify local authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) approval for R290 use in food service area
- **Safety**: Confirm compliance with ASHRAE 15 and local codes for flammable refrigerant charge limits
- **Ventilation**: Verify adequate ventilation per R290 refrigerant requirements

**2. Heat Rejection**
- **Observation**: Self-contained unit will reject heat into HMR sales area
- **HVAC Coordination**: Verify HVAC system capacity accounts for additional heat load (5313 BTU-hr cooling + compressor heat)

**3. Defrost Drainage**
- **Equipment**: Natural defrost indicated
- **Concern**: Verify if condensate drainage required
- **Action**: Coordinate with plumbing contractor if drain connection needed

### Architectural Coordination

**1. Floor Loading**
- **Unit Weight**: Not specified in provided documents
- **Action**: Obtain equipment weight from Dauphinais; verify floor loading capacity

**2. Clearances**

- Equipment power requirements well within circuit capacity

**MEDIUM RISK**:
- R290 refrigerant approval (may require additional documentation)
- Soup well circuit clarification (cost/schedule impact if new circuits needed)
- Panel capacity (verify space available)

**REQUIRES CLARIFICATION**:
- Total number of new circuits (1 or 5?)
- Equipment model number (RDEL-22 vs RDEL-33/35)
- Existing H-21 circuit usage (are these the soup well circuits?)

### Code Compliance Status
**COMPLIANT**: Electrical specifications meet NEC/CEC requirements for conductor sizing, overcurrent protection, and receptacle configuration.

**VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: R290 refrigerant compliance with ASHRAE 15 and local AHJ requirements for flammable refrigerants in occupied food service spaces.
