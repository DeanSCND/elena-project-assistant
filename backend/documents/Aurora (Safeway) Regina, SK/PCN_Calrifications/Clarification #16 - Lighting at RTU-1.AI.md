## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Primary Conflict: RTU-1 Ductwork vs. Type S Luminaires
**Issue**: Two (2) Type S luminaires are located in the path of RTU-1 supply or return ductwork.

**Evidence**:
- Site photo (page002_img001.jpeg) clearly shows large horizontal ductwork running through ceiling space
- Ductwork appears to be substantial (48"-60" wide estimated) and occupies significant vertical clearance
- Original lighting layout would place fixtures in direct conflict with duct path

**Resolution**: Relocate the two fixtures to adjacent locations that:
- Maintain adequate clearance from ductwork
- Preserve lighting design intent and coverage
- Follow Type S mounting requirements (aircraft cable from Unistrut between joists)

### Coordination Requirements

1. **With Mechanical Contractor**:
   - Confirm final ductwork routing for RTU-1
   - Verify clearances for relocated fixtures
   - Ensure no additional conflicts with other HVAC equipment

2. **With Architect**:
   - Verify relocated positions maintain design intent
   - Confirm aesthetic/ceiling layout approval (per General Note 4)
   - Review reflected ceiling plan for any other impacts

3. **With Electrical Contractor**:
   - Verify circuit routing to new fixture locations
   - Confirm Unistrut support locations align with joist spacing
   - Ensure aircraft cable suspension meets code requirements

4. **With Controls Contractor (Micro Thermo West)**:
   - Verify EMS timeclock zone assignments still apply
   - Confirm no changes to control wiring or programming needed

### Potential Additional Issues (Not Stated but Worth Monitoring)

1. **Structural Support**:
   - Verify Unistrut support locations for relocated fixtures don't conflict with ductwork hangers/supports
   - Confirm adequate joist capacity at new mounting points

2. **Emergency Egress Lighting**:
   - If Type S fixtures contribute to egress lighting, verify relocated positions still meet code requirements
   - Check for adequate coverage after relocation

3. **Other Trades**:
   - Verify no conflicts with sprinkler piping, electrical conduit, or other overhead services
   - Check for proper clearances per electrical code (likely Canadian Electrical Code)

4. **Aesthetic Consistency**:
   - Ensure relocated fixtures maintain grid pattern or design rhythm
   - Verify sightlines and visual symmetry from sales floor

## 8. Summary & Analysis Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Clarification Scope**: Relocation of exactly 2 Type S luminaires to accommodate RTU-1 ductwork - a common field coordination issue in retail construction

2. **Visual Evidence**: Site photo clearly shows the scale of ductwork that created the conflict - substantial horizontal duct runs that occupy significant ceiling space

3. **Technical Complexity**: Moderate - Type S fixtures require specific mounting (aircraft cable from Unistrut between joists) which may limit relocation options

4. **Code Compliance**: Straightforward - provided clearances and lighting levels are maintained, no significant code issues anticipated

5. **Project Impact**: Stated as none (no cost or schedule change), but this should be monitored to ensure accuracy

6. **Documentation**: Full-size E1.0 drawing provided but does not show specific relocated positions - suggests field coordination approach

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Early Coordination**: Mechanical and electrical contractors must coordinate final positions before proceeding
2. **Architect Approval**: Essential to maintain design intent
3. **Structural Verification**: Unistrut support locations must align with joist structure
4. **Testing**: Verify lighting levels and control operation after relocation
5. **Documentation**: Capture as-built locations for record drawings

### Risk Assessment
- **Overall Risk**: LOW
- **Schedule Risk**: LOW (simple relocation, no material procurement issues)
- **Cost Risk**: LOW (stated as no cost impact; minimal additional labor)
- **Technical Risk**: LOW (standard coordination issue)
- **Code Compliance Risk**: LOW (straightforward application)

### Conclusion

This is a routine coordination clarification addressing a predictable conflict between HVAC ductwork and lighting fixtures in the sales floor area. The resolution (relocating 2 fixtures) is appropriate and should not create significant technical, cost, or schedule challenges. The key is ensuring proper coordination between mechanical, electrical, and architectural disciplines to select optimal relocated positions that maintain lighting design intent while providing code-compliant clearances from ductwork.

The site photo provides valuable context showing the scale and nature of the ductwork that necessitated this change, and the full electrical plan provides comprehensive background on the overall lighting system design and control strategy.
