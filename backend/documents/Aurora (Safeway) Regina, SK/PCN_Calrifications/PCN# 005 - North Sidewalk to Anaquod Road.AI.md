## 1. Visual Interpretation

### Site Plan Diagram Analysis (page001_img003.jpeg)

**Color Coding:**
- **Red Lines**: Proposed sidewalk/property line modifications showing the new sidewalk extension
- **Green Scalloped Pattern**: Landscaping/vegetation areas (likely existing or proposed planting beds)
- **Blue Dashed Line**: Appears to be a reference line or utility corridor running parallel to Anaquod Road
- **Gray Hatched Area**: Anaquod Road pavement surface
- **Black Lines**: Existing building footprint and structural elements
- **White/Light Gray**: Concrete sidewalk and paved areas

**Spatial Layout:**
- The diagram shows the northwest corner of the site where the building meets Anaquod Road
- North-south oriented sidewalk runs along the west side of the building
- A landscaped area with green scalloped pattern is positioned between the sidewalk and the property line
- The red outline shows the proposed sidewalk extension wrapping around the landscaped area to connect with Anaquod Road
- The sidewalk makes an L-shaped turn from running north-south to east-west to meet the road

**Key Visual Elements:**
- **Keynote Callouts**: Two visible keynote numbers on the plan:
  - "3" - Points to the general sidewalk area
  - "8" - Points to a different location (specific detail not provided in this view)
- **Building Entry**: Visible on the left side with what appears to be entrance doors
- **Existing City Infrastructure**: Gray hatched area representing Anaquod Road at the top of the drawing
- **Property Limits**: Indicated by the red boundary lines

**Diagram Purpose:**
This is a partial site plan excerpt specifically showing the modification area. The view is cropped to focus on the critical zone where the sidewalk extension is required.

## 2. Extracted Dimensions & Specifications

### Scope of Work

**Primary Requirement:**
Continue sidewalk up to Anaquod Road as shown on the modified site plan

**Drawing References:**

---

## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Conflicts

**Landscape Coordination:**
- The green scalloped landscaping area appears to be relocated or reduced to accommodate the sidewalk extension
- Coordination required with landscape architect/designer to adjust planting beds
- Irrigation system may need relocation if present in this area

**Civil/Grading Coordination:**
- Smooth transition requirement indicates critical grading coordination needed
- Must match existing city sidewalk elevation at Anaquod Road
- Drainage patterns may be affected by new sidewalk alignment
- The blue dashed line (potential utility corridor) runs very close to the proposed sidewalk extension

**Utility Conflicts:**
- Blue dashed line proximity to red sidewalk outline suggests potential utility conflict
- Need to verify clearances from underground utilities
- May require utility locates before construction
- Storm drainage catch basins or connections may be present at road interface

**Property Line/ROW Issues:**
- Sidewalk appears to extend to or near property line
- Verify if sidewalk extension requires city right-of-way agreement
- Confirm property limits vs. construction limits

### Missing Information

**Critical Details Not Provided:**
1. Specific sidewalk width dimensions
2. Finished elevation at tie-in point
3. Length of extension
4. Grading/slope percentages
5. Connection detail at city sidewalk (saw-cut, remove/replace, etc.)
6. Landscaping adjustments required
7. Utility clearance confirmations
8. Joint locations and control joint spacing

**Recommended Clarifications:**
- Request full A1.0 Site Plan revision to verify complete scope
- Confirm if landscaping relocation is included in this PCN or separate
- Verify utility clearances with civil engineer
- Confirm city approval status for ROW work

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Accessibility Requirements

**Applicable Codes:**
- National Building Code of Canada (NBC) 2020
- Barrier-Free Design Standard (CSA B651)
- City of Regina Accessibility Design Standards

**Critical Compliance Items:**

**Sidewalk Width:**
- Minimum 1500mm clear width required for barrier-free access
- 1800mm preferred for comfortable two-way pedestrian traffic

**Slope Requirements:**
- Running slope: Maximum 5% (1:20) to avoid being classified as a ramp
- If slope exceeds 5%, ramp requirements apply (handrails, landings, etc.)
- Cross-slope: Maximum 2% (1:50) for drainage

**Transition Details:**
- No vertical discontinuities greater than 13mm
- Transitions greater than 6mm shall be beveled at max 1:2
- "Smooth transition" requirement in keynote aligns with accessibility standards

**Surface Requirements:**
- Slip-resistant surface required
- Broom finish typical for concrete sidewalks
- No gratings with openings greater than 13mm

### Municipal Standards

**City of Regina Requirements:**
- Public sidewalk construction must meet city standards
- Connection to city infrastructure requires inspection/approval
- Right-of-way permits may be required
- As-built documentation likely required for municipal records

### Construction Standards

**Concrete Specifications:**
- Minimum 100mm thickness typical for sidewalks
- Proper sub-base preparation (granular material, compaction)
- Control joints at maximum 3m spacing
- Isolation joints at building interfaces
- Proper curing requirements

**Drainage:**
- Positive drainage away from building
- No ponding on accessible routes
- Connection to storm drainage system if required

### Approval Requirements

**Required Approvals:**
1. Authority Having Jurisdiction (City of Regina)

3. Right-of-way work permit (if sidewalk extends into city ROW)
4. Accessibility compliance review

---

## 6. Construction Considerations

### Sequencing

**Recommended Construction Sequence:**
1. Obtain all necessary permits and approvals
2. Notify utilities for locates (particularly blue line utility)
3. Survey existing city sidewalk elevation
4. Remove/relocate landscaping materials
5. Excavate and prepare sub-base
6. Form and pour new concrete sidewalk
7. Saw-cut and tie into existing city sidewalk
8. Final grading and restoration
9. Reinstall landscaping (if applicable)

### Schedule Impact

**Document Requirements:**
- Contractor must submit signed letter with pricing
- Cost breakdown required
- Change to construction schedule (if any) must be documented
- No work to proceed until Change Order is issued

### Quality Control

**Key Inspection Points:**
- Sub-base compaction
- Formwork alignment and elevation
- Concrete placement and finishing
- Transition elevation matching
- Final accessibility compliance verification

## 7. Cost Considerations

### Scope Items for Pricing

**Direct Costs:**
- Concrete sidewalk removal (if city sidewalk needs modification)
- New concrete sidewalk installation
- Sub-base preparation and granular materials
- Formwork and finishing
- Saw-cutting and tie-in work
- Curing and protection

**Indirect Costs:**
- Engineering/survey for elevations

## 8. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

**1. Elevation Mismatch:**
- Risk: New sidewalk doesn't match existing city sidewalk elevation
- Impact: Accessibility non-compliance, tripping hazard
- Mitigation: Careful survey and elevation control during construction

**2. Utility Conflict:**
- Risk: Blue dashed line utility interferes with sidewalk construction
- Impact: Design revision, schedule delay, additional costs
- Mitigation: Utility locates before design finalization, pothole if necessary

**3. Approval Delays:**
- Risk: City approval process takes longer than anticipated
- Impact: Construction schedule delay
- Mitigation: Early submission to city, follow up on approval status

### Medium Risk Items

**1. Drainage Issues:**
- Risk: New sidewalk creates drainage problems
- Impact: Water ponding, ice formation, property damage
- Mitigation: Proper grading design, coordination with civil engineer

**2. Landscape Coordination:**
- Risk: Conflict between sidewalk and landscape design
- Impact: Rework, aesthetic issues
- Mitigation: Coordination meeting with landscape architect

### Low Risk Items

**1. Material Availability:**
- Risk: Concrete or materials not available when needed
- Impact: Minor schedule delay
- Mitigation: Standard materials, multiple suppliers available
