## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Primary Issue
**Missing Dimensional Control**: Exterior man door locations lack dimensional references from established datum points

### Potential Downstream Impacts

#### 4.1 Construction Sequencing
- **Foundation/Slab Work**: Cannot verify door location relationship to control joints, slab edges
- **Framing**: Rough opening locations cannot be established accurately
- **Exterior Envelope**: Door locations must coordinate with:
  - Window mullions
  - Panel joints
  - Structural grid
  - Expansion joints

#### 4.2 Code Compliance Concerns
- **Egress Path Verification**: Cannot verify minimum egress door spacing requirements
- **Travel Distance**: Door locations affect maximum travel distance calculations
- **Accessibility**: ADA/CSA compliance for accessible entrances requires specific location relationships to:
  - Parking areas
  - Accessible routes
  - Landing dimensions
  - Maneuvering clearances

#### 4.3 Coordination Disciplines
- **MEP Coordination**: Door swing paths may conflict with:
  - Floor drains
  - HVAC penetrations
  - Electrical conduits/panels near entries
- **Site/Civil**: Door locations must coordinate with:
  - Exterior grades
  - Sidewalk locations
  - Curb cuts
  - Drainage patterns

#### 4.4 Safety & Operational Issues
- **Emergency Egress**: Unclear if door locations meet code requirements for:
  - Minimum separation between exits
  - Maximum travel distance to exits
  - Exit discharge locations
- **Fire Department Access**: Exterior door locations affect emergency access compliance

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Building Code Considerations

#### 5.1 Egress Requirements (NBC/IBC)
- **Door Spacing**: Minimum separation between exit doors typically required
- **Travel Distance**: Maximum travel distance to exits must be verified
- **Exit Discharge**: Doors must discharge to approved locations
- **Door Swing**: Direction of swing affects required clear widths

#### 5.2 Accessibility (CSA B651/ADA)
- **Accessible Entrance**: At least one accessible entrance required
- **Landing Requirements**:
  - Minimum 1525mm x 1525mm (60" x 60") landing
  - Level landing required (max 1:50 slope)
  - Landing must be at same elevation as interior floor (or compliant ramp)
- **Maneuvering Clearances**: Required clearances vary by:
  - Door swing direction
  - Approach direction
  - Latch side vs. hinge side approach

#### 5.3 Energy Code Considerations
- **Vestibule Requirements**: May be required for climate zone
- **Door Location**: Affects air infiltration and energy performance
- **Orientation**: North-facing vs. south-facing affects heat loss/gain

#### 5.4 Fire Code
- **Exit Separation**: Exits must be separated per NBC requirements
- **Fire Department Access**: Door locations must provide required access
- **Exit Signage**: Must be visible from required distances

## 6. Required Information for Resolution

### Dimensional Requirements Needed
1. **Horizontal Location Dimensions**:
   - Distance from building corners or established grid lines
   - Distance from adjacent openings (windows, other doors)
   - Centerline or jamb-to-jamb dimensions
   - Relationship to column centerlines (if applicable)

2. **Vertical Control**:
   - Finished floor elevation at door
   - Threshold elevation
   - Head height above finished floor
   - Relationship to finished grade outside

3. **Door Identification**:
   - Door numbers/marks
   - Reference to door schedule
   - Coordination with elevations and floor plans

### Recommended Architect Response
- Revised floor plan sheets showing door locations with dimensions
- Coordination with exterior elevations
- Verification that door locations meet:
  - Code egress requirements
  - Accessibility standards
  - Client operational requirements
  - MEP coordination requirements

---

## 7. Risk Assessment

### Schedule Impact: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Door rough openings are early construction activity
- Foundation/slab work may be ongoing
- Delay in response could impact critical path activities

### Cost Impact: **MEDIUM**
- Potential rework if doors located incorrectly based on assumptions
- Change order potential if coordination issues arise
- Possible premium costs if expedited information needed

### Quality Impact: **HIGH**
- Incorrect door locations could:
  - Violate code requirements
  - Create operational inefficiencies
  - Result in non-compliant accessibility conditions
  - Require costly corrections post-occupancy

### Safety Impact: **HIGH**
- Egress compliance is life-safety critical
- Improper door locations could compromise emergency evacuation
- Fire code violations could delay occupancy permit

---

## 8. Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Within 24-48 hours)
1. **Architect to provide**: Dimensioned floor plans showing all exterior man door locations
2. **Verify coordination**: Check door locations against:
   - Structural grid
   - MEP rough-in
   - Site civil drawings
   - Code requirements

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
1. **Issue revised drawings**: Updated floor plans and elevations
2. **Coordinate disciplines**: Ensure MEP/structural/civil are aware of door locations
3. **Field verification**: Confirm existing conditions allow for specified locations

### Long-term
1. **QA/QC Process**: Review drawing coordination procedures to prevent similar omissions
2. **Checklist Update**: Add door location dimensions to drawing review checklist

---

## 9. Technical Notes

### Construction Best Practices
- Door locations should be dimensioned to structural grid or building corners (fixed datums)
- Avoid dimensioning to elements that may shift (e.g., CMU coursing, panel joints)
- Provide dimensions on floor plans AND verify on elevations
- Note any field verification requirements prior to rough opening installation

### Coordination Requirements
- **Structural**: Verify door locations don't conflict with columns, beams, or bracing
- **Architectural**: Confirm door swing clearances and approach spaces
- **MEP**: Verify no conflicts with floor boxes, drains, or penetrations
- **Site/Civil**: Confirm exterior grades accommodate door thresholds and landings

## Analysis Summary

This RFI identifies a fundamental gap in the construction documentation that must be resolved before exterior envelope work can proceed accurately. The missing door location dimensions affect multiple trades, code compliance verification, and project quality. The architect's response should include fully dimensioned floor plans with door locations referenced to fixed datums, coordinated across all relevant drawing sheets (plans, elevations, details), and verified for code compliance.

**Priority Level**: HIGH
**Recommended Response Time**: 24-48 hours
**Coordination Required**: Multi-discipline review before response issuance
