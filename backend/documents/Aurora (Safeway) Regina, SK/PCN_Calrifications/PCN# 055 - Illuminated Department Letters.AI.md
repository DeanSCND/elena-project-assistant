## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Pending Information
**CRITICAL**: Connection details for MEAT and SEAFOOD signage to follow from TC (Trade Contractor)
- Details expected to be typical/similar to other signs
- May delay installation in these departments until details received

### Coordination Requirements

1. **On-Site Coordination**
   - Final signage locations to be coordinated on site (not fully defined in drawings)
   - Mounting heights to be coordinated with Architect per Reflected Ceiling Plan
   - Coordinate with Architectural Decor Lighting drawings

2. **Lighting Control Integration**
   - All lighting controls to be tied in with Building EMS system
   - Coordinate exact requirements with Micro Thermo West on site
   - Purchase and installation of lighting control equipment through Micro Thermo West

3. **Power Supply Placement**
   - Power supplies must be accessible for maintenance
   - Cannot be mounted directly in letters
   - Location must allow for maximum 10-foot lead cables to maintain LED performance

4. **Multi-Power Supply Service**
   - If more than one power supply used in same area, ALL must be disconnected before servicing
   - Requires coordination with electrical contractor for proper labeling/lockout procedures

### Potential Issues

1. **Panel Capacity**
   - Nine new 15A circuits added to Panel '2L'
   - Verify panel has physical space and ampacity for additional breakers
   - Panel already shows 200A main - confirm load calculations accommodate new circuits

2. **Circuit Distribution**
   - Circuit 21/22 marked as "SPACE" - may indicate future expansion or error
   - Clarify if this circuit is intentionally left blank or if signage assignment is pending

3. **Voltage Drop Considerations**
   - Maximum 10-foot cable length recommended for LED performance
   - Long runs from Panel '2L' in West Staff Corridor to sales floor may require voltage drop calculations
   - Consider local junction boxes or additional panels if voltage drop exceeds acceptable limits

4. **Wiring Color Code Variability**
   - Documents note wiring between PS and letters may be RED/BLACK OR GRAY/WHITE
   - Requires field verification and clear labeling to avoid confusion during maintenance

   - Review mounting heights per RCP
   - Locate and mark power supply locations (accessible, within 10' of letters)

2. **Electrical Rough-In**
   - Install nine new breakers in Panel '2L' (circuits 13-22)
   - Run 120V branch circuits to signage locations
   - Install junction boxes for power supply mounting (accessible locations)
   - Label all circuits clearly per signage location

3. **Signage Installation**
   - Mount letters per manufacturer specifications
   - Install power supplies in accessible locations
   - Connect LED letters to power supplies (verify wire colors)
   - Make final 120V connections to power supplies
   - Test each sign individually before proceeding

4. **Controls Integration**
   - Connect signage circuits to EMS system per Micro Thermo West requirements
   - Program time schedules and control sequences
   - Test automatic control functions

5. **Final Coordination**
   - Await MEAT and SEAFOOD connection details from TC
   - Install these signs per TC specifications when received

### Safety Warnings

1. **Multiple Power Supply Installations**
   - CRITICAL: Disconnect ALL power supplies before servicing any letters in multi-PS installations
   - Label clearly which signs are served by which power supplies
   - Implement proper lockout/tagout procedures

2. **Power Supply Mounting**
   - NEVER mount power supplies directly inside letters
   - Ensure wet-location rated supplies in appropriate environments
   - Maintain ventilation clearances per manufacturer specs

3. **Cable Length Limitations**
   - Do not exceed 10-foot maximum lead cable length
   - Longer runs will degrade LED performance and may void warranty
   - Plan power supply locations accordingly

## Conclusion

PCN# 055 represents a straightforward addition of interior illuminated signage with proper electrical infrastructure. The scope is well-defined with comprehensive manufacturer documentation. Primary coordination points are:

1. **Awaiting TC details** for MEAT and SEAFOOD signage connections
2. **On-site coordination** for final signage placement
3. **EMS integration** with Micro Thermo West
4. **Panel capacity verification** for nine new circuits

The use of UL-listed Gemini LUXE letters with Class 2 power supplies ensures code compliance. LED technology provides energy efficiency and integrates with the building EMS for automatic control.
