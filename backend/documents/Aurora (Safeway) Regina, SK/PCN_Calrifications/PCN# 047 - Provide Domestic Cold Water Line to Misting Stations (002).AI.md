## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Produce Misting Systems - Background:**

Misting systems in grocery produce departments serve multiple purposes:
1. **Product Quality:** Maintains freshness and appearance of produce
2. **Weight Maintenance:** Prevents moisture loss (important for products sold by weight)
3. **Shelf Life Extension:** Reduces wilting and deterioration
4. **Visual Appeal:** Mist creates attractive "fresh" appearance
5. **Customer Experience:** Associated with quality and freshness

**Dry Misting vs. Wet Misting:**

### Dry Misting (Original Specification):
- Uses ultrasonic technology to create fog
- No visible water droplets
- Lower water consumption
- No drainage required
- Higher electrical power requirements
- More expensive equipment
- Minimal water supply needed (reservoir based)

### Wet Misting (This PCN):
- Traditional spray nozzles
- Visible water droplets on produce
- Higher water consumption
- Requires drainage system
- Lower electrical requirements
- Less expensive equipment
- Requires continuous water supply

**The change from dry to wet misting represents a significant system modification.**

**Grid Location 6J Analysis:**

Based on typical grocery store layouts and the grid system shown in PCN #063:
- Grid 6 would be in the produce/fresh departments area (left side of store)
- Grid J is vertical (near back of sales floor)
- **Grid 6J** likely corresponds to produce display case area
- This is consistent with misting system application for produce

**Water Quality Considerations:**

### Filtration Requirements:
- **Sediment Filter:** 20-50 micron to remove particles
- **Fine Filter:** 5-10 micron for misting nozzles
- **Carbon Filter:** May be needed to remove chlorine/taste/odor
- **Filter Location:** Accessible location for cartridge changes
- **Maintenance:** Filters require regular replacement (every 3-6 months)

### Water Chemistry:
- **Hardness:** High mineral content can clog nozzles and leave deposits on produce
- **Chlorine:** High chlorine may affect produce quality
- **Temperature:** Cold water preferred (connects to domestic cold, not hot)
- **Pressure:** Typically 40-80 PSI for proper misting atomization

**Backflow Prevention:**

Required by plumbing code because:
- Misting systems are classified as irrigation applications
- Potential for contamination from produce contact
- Cross-connection control regulations apply
- Must prevent water from flowing back into potable system

Typical requirement:
- **Type:** Reduced Pressure (RP) backflow preventer
- **Installation:** Minimum 12" above floor, accessible location
- **Testing:** Annual certification required
- **Certification:** Must be tested by certified backflow tester

**Misting System Operation:**

Typical control sequence:
1. Timer or humidity sensor activates misting
2. Solenoid valve opens (powered by electrical circuit O-39/O-40)
3. Water flows through nozzles for 10-30 seconds
4. Solenoid closes
5. Cycle repeats every 5-15 minutes (adjustable)
6. System shuts down during store closed hours
7. Drainage removes excess water

**Refrigeration Case Integration:**

Modern produce cases with integrated misting typically include:
- Built-in misting nozzles in canopy
- Drain trough to collect runoff
- Solenoid valve for water control
- Timer or humidity-based controller
- Connection point (usually at case end or top)

**Code References:**
- **Canadian Plumbing Code:** Water supply, backflow prevention
- **Local Health Code:** Water quality for food contact
- **NSF/ANSI 61:** Plumbing components in contact with potable water
- **CSA B64.10:** Backflow prevention requirements

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Filter replacement: Every 3-6 months
- Backflow preventer testing: Annual
- Nozzle cleaning: Monthly to quarterly
- Water quality testing: As required by health code
- System inspection: Weekly during operation

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MODERATE RISK** - System type change (dry to wet)
- **COORDINATION RISK** - Heavy refrigeration contractor coordination required
- **SCHEDULE RISK** - May affect refrigeration case specifications if already ordered
- **COST IMPACT** - Moderate, but ongoing operational costs for water/filters
- **COMPLIANCE RISK** - Backflow prevention and water quality requirements

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **URGENT:** Coordinate with Refrigeration Contractor immediately
2. Verify if produce cases are already ordered/specified
3. Determine if cases accommodate wet misting or require modification
4. Obtain misting system specifications and water requirements
5. Locate nearest suitable cold water line for connection
6. Calculate water demand for all misting nozzles
7. Verify pressure availability at connection point
8. Specify backflow preventer type and location
9. Determine filtration requirements
10. Design pipe routing for minimal visual impact
11. Coordinate with electrical for misting controls (circuits O-39/O-40)
12. Verify drainage capacity of produce cases
13. Plan commissioning procedure
14. Develop maintenance schedule and training
15. Update O&M manuals with system operation
16. Coordinate with health inspector if required for water quality

**Long-term Operational Considerations:**
- **Water Costs:** Ongoing utility expense
- **Maintenance:** Regular filter changes and backflow testing
- **Water Waste:** Drainage water not reused
- **Environmental:** Wet misting more sustainable than refrigeration-intensive dry misting
- **Staff Training:** Store personnel must understand system operation
