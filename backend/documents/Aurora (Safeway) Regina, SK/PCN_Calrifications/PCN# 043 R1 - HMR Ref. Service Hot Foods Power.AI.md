## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Coordination Issues:

1. **Power Supply Modification Timing**:
   - Issue: Converting from 3-phase to 1-phase power requires panel schedule modification
   - Impact: Panel H circuit assignments need verification for available 70A-2P breaker space
   - Action Required: Verify Panel H has adequate capacity and available space

2. **Hub Drain Installation**:
   - Issue: New hub drain must be installed in area highlighted in red (MP-07A drawing)
   - Coordination: Must coordinate with concrete work if foundation already poured
   - Impact: May require saw-cutting existing slab if work not completed during rough-in
   - Action Required: Confirm construction status and schedule coordination

3. **Equipment Change Notice**:
   - Issue: Equipment change from self-service to full-service affects millwork and counter design
   - Coordination: Must coordinate with millwork contractor for any counter/service area modifications
   - Impact: Service counter layout may need adjustment
   - Action Required: Verify millwork shop drawings accommodate full-service configuration

4. **Dual Power Requirements**:
   - Issue: Equipment now requires TWO separate circuits (main power + receptacle)
   - Coordination: Routing of two separate home runs to single equipment location
   - Impact: Conduit coordination in wall/floor cavities
   - Action Required: Confirm rough-in complete or coordinate conduit paths

5. **Equipment Cut Sheet Discrepancy**:
   - Issue: Cut sheet shows "8'-0" REF. SERVICE HOT FOODS (INSULATED)" with yellow highlighting and notation "0 KW, NO 4TEM" (likely "NO ITEM")
   - Concern: Visual appears to indicate equipment was originally marked as "no electrical" or "deleted"
   - Action Required: Confirm equipment specification matches actual unit being supplied

6. **Load Calculation Verification**:
   - Issue: Change from 3-phase to 1-phase redistributes electrical load on panel
   - Impact: Panel H phase balancing may need review
   - Action Required: Electrical engineer to verify panel load calculations and phase balance

7. **Equipment Location H-22**:
   - Issue: Drawing E2.4 shows equipment tag H-22 but actual location needs field verification
   - Coordination: Ensure adequate space for service-side access (staff serving customers)
   - Action Required: Field verify clearances and ADA compliance for service counter

### No Major Conflicts Identified:
- Pipe sizing appears adequate for added drain
- Panel capacity appears sufficient (400A panel for added load)
- Room layout accommodates equipment change

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Electrical Code Considerations:

1. **NEC/CEC Wire Sizing**:
   - #4 AWG copper specified for 70A-2P circuit (68 MCA load)
   - Complies with 125% rule: 68A × 1.25 = 85A → 70A breaker adequate with #4 wire
   - Verify: Temperature rating of wire (75°C or 90°C) and termination ratings

2. **Separate Receptacle Circuit**:
   - 120V-1PH, 15A-1P isolated receptacle specified
   - Likely for auxiliary equipment (warming lights, controls, etc.)
   - ISO designation suggests isolated ground requirement
   - Compliance: Verify isolated ground required per manufacturer specs

3. **GFCI/AFCI Requirements**:
   - Not specified in documents
   - Action Required: Verify if commercial kitchen equipment requires GFCI protection per local code
   - Note: Large fixed appliances typically exempt, but receptacle circuits may require protection

4. **Overcurrent Protection**:
   - Drawing notes specify "All starters are to be complete with overcurrent protection"
   - 70A-2P and 15A-1P breakers specified
   - Compliance: Adequate per NEC Article 422 (Appliances)

5. **Conduit Fill**:
   - Note specifies "Provide 1" diameter conduit as indicated"
   - Action Required: Verify conduit fill calculations for #4 wire in 1" conduit
   - Consideration: May need larger conduit depending on number of conductors and insulation type

6. **Equipment Grounding**:
   - Drawing notes: "Provide a neutral wire for all equipment"
   - Compliance: Required per NEC Article 250 for grounding
   - ISO receptacle may require separate equipment grounding conductor

### Plumbing Code Considerations:

1. **Hub Drain Sizing**:
   - Drain size not explicitly specified on MP-07A
   - Appears to connect to 3" drain line based on plan
   - Compliance: Must size per fixture unit load and local plumbing code

2. **Trap Requirements**:
   - Hub drains typically require integral trap
   - Action Required: Verify trap prime maintenance method (trap primer or other)

3. **Cleanout Access**:
   - CHD (Cleanout Hub Drain) indicated on plan
   - Compliance: Adequate cleanout access required per code

4. **Floor Slope**:
   - Hub drain installation requires proper floor slope
   - Action Required: Coordinate with concrete/flooring contractor for drainage slope

### General Code Notes:

1. **ADA/Accessibility**:
   - Full-service configuration implies staff serving customers
   - Action Required: Verify counter height, reach ranges, and approach clearances comply with ADA
   - Consider: Service counter height typically 34"-36" for accessibility

2. **Food Service Code**:
   - Equipment in food preparation area subject to health code requirements
   - Action Required: Verify equipment NSF certified and installation meets health code
   - Drainage: Proper drainage required for food service equipment cleaning

3. **Coordination with Authority Having Jurisdiction**:
   - PCN cover states: "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
   - Action Required: Submit to local building official and health department for approval

## 6. Installation Requirements & Notes

### From Drawing E2.4 Notes:

1. **General Coordination**:
   - "Electrical contractor to verify dimensions and locations prior to rough-in"
   - "Confirm all equipment loads, circuit sizes, and mounting heights prior to rough-in"
   - "Coordinate final location and power/control requirements with equipment suppliers"

2. **Equipment Connections**:
   - "Wire and connect all kitchen equipment as indicated"
   - "Provide wiring and circuit breakers to final nameplate of equipment"
   - "Contractor to confirm exact quantities and locations with approved equipment package"

3. **Interlocking & Controls**:
   - "Provide all relays & wiring for interlocking of all equipment as required"
   - "Provide all line voltage control wiring as required"
   - "Confirm and coordinate exact requirements on site"

4. **Receptacle Labeling**:
   - "Provide permanent type written label on all receptacles identifying circuit number and panel board name"

5. **Waterproofing**:
   - "All receptacles within preparation areas to be waterproof"
   - HMR area qualifies as preparation area - receptacle must be weatherproof/waterproof type

6. **Verification Requirements**:
   - "Verify mounting height and exact location of receptacles and stub-ups"
   - "Coordinate with mill work, mechanical, refrigeration contractor, sub trades prior to rough-in"

### From Mechanical Drawing MP-07A:
