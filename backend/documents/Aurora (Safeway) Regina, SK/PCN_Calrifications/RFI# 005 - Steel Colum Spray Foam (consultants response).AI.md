## 4. Identified Conflicts

### Primary Coordination Issue (From Original RFI)
**Drawing Set Inconsistency:**
- A5 wall sections show spray foam in "most exterior girts and open cavities"
- A6 plan details do NOT show spray foam in columns
- Unclear if columns qualify as "open cavities" requiring spray foam

### Interpretation Ambiguities
1. **Scope Definition**: Does "open cavities" include hollow structural steel columns?
2. **Section vs. Plan**: Why would sections show foam but plans omit it?
3. **Specification Gap**: No clear specification section referenced (marked "N/A")
4. **Design Intent**: Was column insulation intended but omitted from plans, or intentionally excluded?

### Construction Impact
- **Cost Uncertainty**: Column spray foam can be expensive material and labor
- **Schedule Impact**: Marked "As Soon As Possible" indicating critical path item
- **Trade Coordination**: Affects steel erectors, insulators, and wall assembly sequence
- **Material Procurement**: Cannot order spray foam quantities without clarification

### Potential Technical Conflicts
1. **Thermal Performance**: Uninsulated columns create thermal bridges
2. **Energy Code Compliance**: May not meet continuous insulation requirements
3. **Fire Protection**: Exposed steel may require fire-rated protection
4. **Condensation Risk**: Cold steel columns in insulated walls can condense
5. **Air Barrier Continuity**: Column penetrations need proper sealing strategy

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Energy Code Considerations

#### Saskatchewan Energy Code / NBC 2020 Energy Efficiency
- **Thermal Bridging**: Steel columns are significant thermal bridges (high conductivity)
- **Continuous Insulation**: Modern codes require continuous insulation or equivalent
- **Thermal Resistance**: Uninsulated steel can reduce effective wall R-value by 20-40%
- **Building Envelope Performance**: Energy model likely assumes certain insulation strategy

#### Prescriptive vs. Performance Path
- If prescriptive path: specific R-values required including thermal break strategies
- If performance path: energy model assumptions must match as-built condition
- **Critical Question**: Did energy calculations assume insulated or uninsulated columns?

### Building Code - Fire Protection

#### NBC 2020 Fire Protection Requirements
- **Building Classification**: Retail food store occupancy classification
- **Fire Resistance Rating**: Structural steel may require fire protection depending on:
  - Building height and area
  - Occupancy load
  - Required fire resistance rating (likely 1-hour or 2-hour)
  - Proximity to property lines

#### Spray Foam as Fire Protection
- **Fire Rating**: If spray foam is intended for fire protection, must be rated product
- **Testing Certification**: Must meet CAN/ULC standards for fire resistance
- **Application Thickness**: Fire-rated spray foam requires specific minimum thickness
- **Installation Certification**: May require certified applicators

### Building Envelope Code Issues

#### Air Barrier Compliance
- **Continuity**: NBC requires continuous air barrier system
- **Penetrations**: All envelope penetrations must be sealed
- **Steel Columns**: Create air barrier discontinuity if not properly detailed
- **Testing**: May be subject to building envelope commissioning/testing

#### Vapor Control
- **Vapor Barrier**: Required in Saskatchewan climate (cold climate, heating dominated)
- **Condensation Control**: Steel columns can be condensation surfaces
- **Spray Foam Properties**: Closed-cell spray foam can serve as air and vapor barrier
- **Thickness Requirements**: Minimum thickness for vapor impermeability

### Accessibility and Safety
- **Fire Egress**: Column fire protection affects structural integrity during fire
- **Life Safety**: Building occupant safety depends on structural fire resistance
- **Accessibility**: Not directly applicable to column insulation

### Code Compliance Questions Requiring Consultant Response
1. **Energy Code**: Does the building energy model assume insulated columns?
2. **Fire Code**: What is the required fire resistance rating for these columns?
3. **Envelope Code**: What is the air barrier and vapor barrier strategy at columns?
4. **Compliance Path**: Prescriptive or performance compliance for energy code?

## 6. Technical Analysis

### Spray Foam in Steel Columns - Technical Considerations

#### If Columns ARE to be Spray Foamed:

**Application Requirements:**
- **Access**: Column openings must be accessible for spray application
- **Coverage**: Ensure complete fill without voids
- **Thickness**: Specify minimum thickness for thermal and/or fire performance
- **Density**: Specify closed-cell vs. open-cell foam type
- **Fire Rating**: If required, specify ULC-rated product and thickness

**Coordination Requirements:**
- **Steel Erection**: Columns must be plumb and aligned before foam
- **Welding**: Complete all welding before foam (fire hazard)
- **Protection**: Protect foam from construction damage
- **Inspection**: Verify complete fill (visual or thermal imaging)
- **Sequencing**: Foam before exterior wall closure

**Cost Implications:**
- Material: Spray foam for steel columns is premium cost
- Labor: Specialized application, potential for difficult access
- Equipment: Spray foam equipment and certified applicators
- Inspection: May require third-party verification

#### If Columns ARE NOT to be Spray Foamed:

**Alternative Strategies Required:**
- **Thermal Break**: Detail at column/wall interface to minimize bridging
- **Wrap Insulation**: Rigid insulation wrapping around column exterior
- **Fire Protection**: Alternative fire-rated enclosure (gypsum board, intumescent paint, etc.)
- **Air Sealing**: Gaskets, sealant, or spray foam at penetrations only
- **Vapor Barrier**: Continuous vapor barrier detail around column

**Design Clarifications Needed:**
- How to handle thermal bridging at columns
- Fire protection method if not spray foam
- Air barrier continuity detail
- Vapor barrier continuity detail

### Building Science Considerations

#### Thermal Performance
- **Thermal Bridging**: Uninsulated steel column can reduce wall R-value significantly
  - Steel thermal conductivity: ~45 W/m·K
  - Spray foam thermal conductivity: ~0.02-0.04 W/m·K
  - Thermal bridge factor can be 1000x or more
- **Heat Loss Calculation**: Localized heat loss at each column location
- **Surface Temperature**: Cold steel creates condensation risk on interior side

#### Moisture Management
- **Condensation Risk**: Cold steel in warm, humid interior air
- **Dew Point**: Interior surface temperature below dew point = condensation
- **Mold Risk**: Persistent condensation leads to mold growth
- **Durability**: Condensation can cause corrosion of steel

#### Air Leakage
- **Stack Effect**: Tall buildings have significant air pressure differences
- **Column Penetrations**: Each column penetrates roof/wall assemblies
- **Air Leakage Path**: Unsealed columns are direct air leakage paths
- **Energy Penalty**: Air leakage is major energy loss in buildings
