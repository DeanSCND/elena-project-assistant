## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### 4.1 Potential Structural Conflicts

**Grade Beam Exposure:**
- **Issue**: PCN title "Grade Beam Covering" suggests exposed structural grade beams requiring architectural finish
- **Concern**: Original design may not have accounted for these exposed conditions
- **Questions**:
  - Were grade beams supposed to be below finished floor?
  - Has site grading changed from original design?
  - Are there additional locations with exposed grade beams?

**Foundation Height Matching:**
- **Specification**: Curb to be "same height as adjacent foundation"
- **Concern**: If foundation heights vary, curb height may need adjustment
- **Recommendation**: Field verify foundation heights before forming curbs

### 4.2 Waterproofing Coordination

**Vapor Barrier Continuity:**
- **Critical detail**: Vapor barrier must "tie into frame" at storefront
- **Concern**: Coordination required between:
  - Below-slab vapor barrier system
  - Wall vapor barrier
  - Storefront frame installation sequence
- **Risk**: Broken vapor barrier path could allow moisture infiltration

**Sealant Locations:**
- **Specified**: "2 continuous beads of sealant"
- **Concern**: Sealant type not specified (could be structural vs. non-structural)
- **Missing info**: Substrate preparation requirements, primer requirements, joint sizing

### 4.3 Dimensional Conflicts

**Rubber Base vs. Sill Termination:**
- **Rubber base**: 6" height specified "as per decor"
- **Sill termination**: 5" AFF
- **Calculation**: 1" overlap/coverage required
- **Concern**: If rubber base is less than 6" or not installed properly, gap will occur
- **Recommendation**: Sequence sill installation after rubber base verification

**Vestibule Curb Depth:**
- **Specified**: 4" deep curb
- **Concern**: Floor substrate thickness not shown
  - If floor system is less than 4" thick, curb may conflict with structural slab
  - May require saw-cutting existing concrete
- **Missing info**: Existing floor assembly thickness and composition

### 4.4 Finish Coordination

**Epoxy Paint in Vestibule:**
- **Specified**: "Grey epoxy paint over concrete foundation/curb"
- **Concerns**:
  - Epoxy paint not specified by product/manufacturer
  - Color "grey" is subjective without specific color code
  - Surface preparation requirements not stated
  - High-traffic area requires durable coating
  - May require slip-resistance additives
- **Questions**:
  - Is this the same grey as other building elements?
  - Who provides paint specification? Architect or owner?

**Stainless Steel Finish:**
- **Specified**: "Stainless steel" sill
- **Missing specifications**:
  - Grade (304, 316, etc.)
  - Finish (mill, #4 brushed, mirror, etc.)
  - Gauge/thickness
  - Fabrication tolerances
  - Shop drawing approval requirements
- **Concern**: Custom fabrication requires detailed shop drawings and approval process

### 4.5 Schedule/Sequencing Issues

**Late-Stage Addition:**
- **Timing**: PCN issued December 3, 2025
- **Concern**: Grade beam covering typically occurs early in construction
- **Implications**:
  - May require removal of completed work
  - Could impact flooring installation schedule
  - Storefront/glazing may already be installed
  - Could delay substantial completion

**Work Sequence Dependencies:**
1. Structural grade beams (complete - exposed condition exists)
2. Concrete curb forming and placement (pending)
3. Epoxy paint application (pending - requires curing time)
4. Flooring installation in vestibule (may be impacted)
5. Rubber base installation at storefront (must precede sill)
6. Stainless steel sill fabrication (lead time required)
7. Sill installation (after base verification)

### 4.6 Code Compliance Considerations

**Tripping Hazard:**
- **Curb height**: 8" height creates potential tripping hazard
- **Concern**: May require visual contrast marking or warning per accessibility codes
- **Chamfer benefit**: 1"x1" chamfer reduces sharp edge but doesn't eliminate hazard

**Accessibility:**
- **Location**: Vestibule is main building entrance
- **Concern**: 8" curb may create accessibility barrier
- **Question**: Is this curb at a change in elevation (interior/exterior threshold)?
- **Code reference**: Check local building code and barrier-free design requirements

**Moisture Protection:**
- **Critical**: Vapor barrier continuity essential for building envelope performance
- **Concern**: Field modifications increase risk of membrane damage
- **Recommendation**: Special inspection of vapor barrier lapping and sealing
