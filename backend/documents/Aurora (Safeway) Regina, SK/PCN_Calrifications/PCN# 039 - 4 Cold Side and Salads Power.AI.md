## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Electrical Conflicts

#### CRITICAL: Voltage Change
- **Original Equipment**: Mobile Holding Cabinet requiring 120V-1PH
- **New Equipment**: 4' Cold Side and Salads requiring 208V-1PH
- **Impact**: Requires complete circuit rewiring if already installed
- **Action Required**: Verify if original 120V circuit has been installed; if so, requires removal and replacement with 208V circuit

#### Circuit Breaker Modification
- **Original**: 20A-1P (single pole) breaker
- **Revised**: 15A-2P (two pole) breaker
- **Issue**: Different panel space requirement - 2 spaces instead of 1
- **Coordination**: Verify panel H has two adjacent spaces available for 2-pole breaker

#### Receptacle Change
- **Original**: NEMA 5-15 receptacle (120V, 15A)
- **Revised**: NEMA 6-15 receptacle (208V, 15A)
- **Issue**: Incompatible receptacle types - equipment cannot plug into wrong voltage
- **Safety Note**: This is a safety feature preventing incorrect voltage application

### Physical Installation Conflicts

#### Clearance Requirements
Per manufacturer specifications (Page 9 notes):
- **Minimum clearance from wall**: 100mm (4") for plug-in devices
- **Side glass clearance**: Must be away from walls to ensure air flow for glass drying
- **Action Required**: Verify 4" minimum clearance at rear and sides in HMR layout

#### Ventilation Requirements
- Equipment requires proper air circulation for:
  - Condenser cooling (rear-mounted compressor)
  - Side glass anti-condensation air flow
  - Maximum ambient air speed: 0.2 m/s
- **Coordination**: Review HVAC design to ensure proper air distribution without excessive velocity

### Refrigeration Conflicts

#### Refrigerant Type (R290 - Propane)
- **Issue**: R290 is a hydrocarbon refrigerant (flammable)
- **Code Requirement**: May require special ventilation or installation restrictions
- **Charge**: 150g (below many threshold limits)
- **Action Required**: Verify local code compliance for hydrocarbon refrigerants in occupied spaces
- **Canadian Compliance**: Check CSA B52 requirements for R290 refrigerant charge limits

#### Condensate Drainage
- Equipment has "automatic evaporation of condensate"
- **Potential Issue**: In high-humidity environments, evaporation may be insufficient
- **Coordination**: Verify if floor drain or condensate pump backup is required per local code
- **Note**: Drawing shows condensate water drainage symbol but specifies automatic evaporation

### Temperature Classification Conflict

#### Climate Class Limitation
- **Equipment Rated**: Climate Class 3 (77°F / 25°C maximum ambient)
- **Typical Retail Environment**: May exceed 77°F during peak hours or HVAC failure
- **Action Required**:
  - Verify HVAC design maintains ambient below 77°F at equipment location
  - Consider if higher climate class equipment is needed
  - Review store operating procedures for high ambient conditions

### Load Calculation Impact

#### Panel H Loading
- **Original Load**: Mobile Holding Cabinet ~2.4kW (assumed)
- **New Load**: 1.275kW rated, 18.44 kWh/24h
- **Net Change**: Likely reduction in connected load but verify panel capacity
- **Action Required**: Update electrical load calculations and panel schedules

### Construction Sequence Issues

#### Equipment Lead Time
- **Equipment Source**: Poland (JBG-2) via Canadian distributor
- **Potential Delay**: International shipping and customs clearance
- **Action Required**:
  - Verify equipment delivery schedule
  - Confirm equipment is available from Dauphinais stock
  - Check for potential substitute if lead time is excessive

#### Installation Coordination
Per Drawing E2.4 notes:
1. Electrical contractor must verify dimensions and mounting heights
2. Coordinate with millwork, mechanical, and refrigeration contractors
3. Verify final location before rough-in
4. Equipment must be wired to final nameplate ratings

**Issue**: Self-contained plug-in equipment typically installed late in schedule
- May conflict with millwork or flooring installation
- Requires accessible receptacle location for plug-in connection

- **Directory**: Panel directory must identify "4' Cold Side and Salads - H-24"
- **Receptacle Labeling**: Per drawing notes, permanent typed label required on receptacle identifying circuit number and panel name

### Refrigeration Code Issues

#### Refrigerant R290 (Propane) - CSA B52
- **Classification**: A3 refrigerant (low toxicity, high flammability)
- **Charge Limit**: 150g charge is below most threshold limits
- **CSA B52 Compliance**:
  - Verify charge limit for occupied space application
  - Typical limit: 150g for commercial refrigeration in occupied spaces (compliant)
  - May require refrigerant detection if multiple R290 units in same space
- **Ventilation**: Adequate ventilation required to prevent refrigerant accumulation
- **Signage**: May require refrigerant type identification label

#### Pressure Vessel Requirements
- **Maximum Allowable Pressure**: 30 bar (435 psi)
- **Registration**: Verify if pressure vessel registration required in Saskatchewan
- **Inspection**: May require periodic inspection depending on jurisdiction

### Food Safety Code Issues

#### Temperature Compliance
- **Working Temperature**: +35.6°F to +39.2°F (+2°C to +4°C)
- **Food Safety**: Complies with typical cold food holding requirements (below 41°F)
- **Product Temperature**: +30.2°F to +44.6°F range allows for proper cold food storage
- **Monitoring**: Electronic temperature display aids HACCP compliance

#### Sanitation Requirements
- **Surfaces**: Black powder-coated metal shelves must be food-safe coating
- **Cleanability**: Glass shelves are easily cleanable
- **Materials**: Verify NSF or equivalent certification for food contact surfaces
- **Drainage**: Automatic condensate evaporation prevents standing water

### Building Code Issues

#### Clearances
- **Combustible Materials**: Verify clearance to combustible construction
- **Compressor Ventilation**: Rear clearance of 100mm (4") required for cooling
- **Service Access**: Must maintain access for service and cleaning

#### Energy Code Compliance
- **Energy Efficiency**: Class F rating indicates moderate efficiency
- **Display Case Requirements**: Verify compliance with energy code for refrigerated display cases
- **Doors/Covers**: Equipment has no doors - verify if night covers required by energy code

### Accessibility Code

#### Customer Access
- **Display Opening**: 735mm (29") height - verify ADA/accessibility compliance for reach ranges
- **Low Glass Front**: Allows customer access from seated or standing positions
- **Aisle Width**: Verify aisle width in front of case meets accessibility requirements
