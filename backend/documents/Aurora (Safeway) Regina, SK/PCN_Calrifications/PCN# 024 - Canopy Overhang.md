Drawings #

ISSUE REQUIRING RESPONSE: 
 
1) The very top cap of the canopy overhangs to the south too far. It overhangs the outside sheathing of 
the ACM build out by approx. 16”.  On drawing S2.4 detail 5, the front portal framing detail shows the 
overhang is 3’-5” past grid line F.  On drawing A5.0 section 3, the outside of the steel stud wall is shown 
to be 1’-1 ½” of grid line F.  How are we to proceed?
