## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### 4.1 Potential Conflicts

**Wall Thickness Coordination**:
- 9" wall between consultation room and dispensary may conflict with millwork layout
- RX Storage width reduced from 5'-0" to 4'-8" due to wall shift - verify adequate storage capacity remains
- Confirm structural column location doesn't interfere with accessibility clearances

**Plumbing Coordination**:
- Wall-mounted sink requires coordination with:
  - Wall framing (9" thickness accommodates rough-in)
  - Electrical for soap/towel dispensers
  - Drain line routing through floor
  - Vent line routing to roof
- Confirm drain location doesn't conflict with structural elements below

**Accessibility Clearances**:
- 5'-4" turning diameter must be maintained clear of all obstructions
- Wall-mounted sink projection must not reduce required clearances
- Door swing must provide adequate maneuvering clearance per code

### 4.2 Design Changes Impact

**Modifications NOT Required** (per PCN):
- "Modifications to the Pharmacy Storage Room noted on the Fixture Plan are not required"
- This suggests original fixture plan showed storage room changes that are now cancelled

**Waiting Area Reduction**:
- Reduction from original size may impact patient queuing capacity
- Wall extension to align with bulkhead changes sightlines from sales floor

**Window W11 Wall Change**:
- Increased wall thickness (3-5/8" to 8") may affect:
  - Window rough opening dimensions
  - Interior/exterior trim details
  - Head/sill conditions

### 4.3 Outstanding Items

**Final Sink Selection**:
- PCN states: "Final sink selection to be clarified/determined at a later date"
- Must comply with Saskatchewan Health Authority standards
- Coordination required with millwork/finishes
- Equipment submittal required before rough-in

**Cost & Schedule Impact**:
- Contractor required to submit signed letter with:
  - Price including cost breakdown
  - Change to construction schedule (if any)
- No work to proceed before Change Order issuance
