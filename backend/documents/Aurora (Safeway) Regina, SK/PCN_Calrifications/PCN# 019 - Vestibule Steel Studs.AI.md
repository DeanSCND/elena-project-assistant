## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Conflicts

#### 1. Wall Thickness Impact
- **Issue**: Increasing stud depth from 3 5/8" (actual 3.625") to 6" adds 2.375" to wall thickness
- **Impact Areas**:
  - Floor plan dimensions and room sizes
  - Door frame depths and jamb details
  - Electrical/mechanical rough-in depths
  - Finish material transitions at vestibule openings
- **Coordination Required**: Verify door hardware, frame, and rough-in compatibility

#### 2. Structural Shop Drawing Requirements
- **Issue**: Wall Type Note #6.13 requires P.Eng sealed shop drawings for walls 17'-0" A.F.F. or higher
- **Question**: Does the vestibule wall height exceed 17'-0" A.F.F.?
- **Action Required**:
  - Verify actual vestibule wall height
  - Determine if P.Eng shop drawings are required
  - Identify structural engineer of record for sealing
- **Timeline Impact**: Shop drawing review and sealing will add time to schedule

#### 3. Glazing/Aluminum Frame Coordination
- **Issue**: Section 1.4 mentions "reduction of aluminum frames/glazing as per Clarification 2445-05"
- **Conflict Potential**:
  - Thicker walls may affect glazing frame pocket dimensions
  - Sightline changes at wall-to-glazing transitions
  - Mullion connection details may need revision
- **Action Required**: Review aluminum storefront shop drawings for compatibility

#### 4. Gauge Specification vs. Actual Design
- **Issue**: Wall Type Note #6.13 specifies minimum gauges (18ga, 20ga, 25ga) based on height
- **Proposed Design**: 6" steel studs (gauge not specified in PCN)
- **Question**: What gauge are the proposed 6" studs?
- **Action Required**: Confirm proposed stud gauge meets Wall Type Note #6.13 requirements

#### 5. Missing Visual Information
- **Issue**: 3 of 4 referenced images are missing from the extracted package
- **Missing Images**:
  - page001_img001.jpeg (cover page header)
  - page002_img001.jpeg (page 2 header)
  - page002_img002.jpeg (page 2 technical detail - likely shows vestibule detail)
- **Impact**: Cannot fully analyze Page 2 content which may contain critical visual information
- **Action Required**: Obtain complete image set for full analysis

### Inconsistencies

#### 1. Specification Reference Completeness
- **Observation**: Section 05 41 00 is referenced but no specific article or paragraph cited
- **Recommendation**: Reference specific articles for stud gauge, deflection criteria, and installation requirements

#### 2. Credit Scope Definition
- **Item 1.1**: "Provide credit for deletion of 3 5/8" studs"
- **Item 1.4**: "Provide credit for reduction of aluminum frames/glazing"
- **Issue**: No quantities or linear footage specified for pricing
- **Action Required**: Contractor must survey existing conditions or reference base drawings for quantities

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Structural Requirements

#### P.Eng Sealed Shop Drawings
- **Requirement**: Wall Type Note #6.13 mandates P.Eng sealed shop drawings for walls 17'-0" A.F.F. or higher
- **Regulatory Basis**:
  - Likely driven by provincial building code requirements for tall non-load-bearing partitions
  - Saskatchewan building code may require structural review for lateral stability of tall walls
- **Compliance Path**:
  - Structural engineer must review and seal shop drawings
  - Drawings must demonstrate lateral bracing, deflection control, and seismic resistance
  - Submit to Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) for approval

#### Stud Gauge Requirements by Height
- **Code Intent**: Progressive gauge requirements ensure adequate lateral resistance and deflection control
- **Compliance**: Must match or exceed minimums in Wall Type Note #6.13
  - 18 gauge min for ≥17'-0" A.F.F.
  - 20 gauge min for 12'-0" to 17'-0" A.F.F.
  - 25 gauge min for ≤12'-0" A.F.F.

### Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

#### Notification Requirement
- **Stated on PCN**: "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- **Process**:
  - AHJ must review proposed change
  - AHJ approval required before work proceeds
  - No work permitted until Change Order is issued

#### Building Permit Impact
- **Consideration**: Increasing wall thickness and structural capacity may require building permit amendment
- **Action Required**: Verify if change requires permit revision submission to AHJ

### Specification Compliance

#### Section 05 41 00 Structural Metal Framing
- **Code Reference**: This specification section governs:
  - Material standards (ASTM C645 for studs, ASTM C754 for installation)
  - Deflection limits (typically L/120 or L/240 for non-load-bearing walls)
  - Bracing requirements
  - Connection details
- **Compliance Verification**: Confirm 6" studs are available in required gauges per ASTM C645

### Fire and Life Safety
- **Potential Impact**: Increased wall thickness may affect:
  - Fire-resistance ratings (if vestibule walls are fire-rated)
  - Egress width calculations at vestibule openings
  - Smoke barrier continuity (if applicable)
- **Action Required**: Verify fire-rating requirements for vestibule walls

---

## 6. Technical Analysis

### Structural Considerations

#### Stud Size Upgrade Rationale
- **From**: 3 5/8" (92mm) studs
- **To**: 6" (152mm) studs
- **Potential Reasons**:
  1. Increased lateral load resistance (wind or seismic)
  2. Deflection control for tall walls
  3. Accommodation of thicker insulation
  4. Structural engineer's requirement from Clarification 2445-05
  5. Coordination with glazing system depths

#### Capacity Improvement
- **Section Modulus Increase**: 6" studs provide significantly higher section modulus than 3 5/8" studs
- **Lateral Stiffness**: ~65% increase in moment of inertia
- **Deflection Reduction**: For same load, deflection reduces by ~40%

### Cost Implications

#### Material Cost Changes
- **Added Cost**: 6" studs (larger size, potentially heavier gauge)
- **Credit 1**: Deletion of 3 5/8" studs
- **Credit 2**: Reduction of aluminum frames/glazing per Clarification 2445-05
- **Net Cost**: To be determined by contractor pricing submission

#### Soft Cost Impacts
- **P.Eng Shop Drawing Review**: Engineering fees if walls ≥17'-0" A.F.F.
- **Schedule Delay**: Shop drawing preparation, review, and approval cycle
- **Coordination Meetings**: Additional RFI resolution time

### Schedule Impact

#### Critical Path Items
1. **Clarification 2445-05 Review**: Must understand full scope before pricing
2. **Height Verification**: Determines if P.Eng shop drawings required
3. **Shop Drawing Preparation**: 2-3 weeks if required
4. **Structural Engineer Review**: 1-2 weeks
5. **AHJ Review**: Variable (1-3 weeks typical)
6. **Material Procurement**: 6" studs may have longer lead time than 3 5/8"

#### Recommendation
- **Action**: Expedite height verification to determine shop drawing requirement
- **Critical**: Include shop drawing timeline in schedule impact submission

## Conclusion

This PCN represents a significant structural upgrade to the vestibule interior walls, changing from 3 5/8" to 6" steel studs per Clarification 2445-05. The change is relatively straightforward in concept but has several critical coordination requirements:

**Key Findings:**
- Wall Type Note #6.13 mandates P.Eng sealed shop drawings for walls ≥17'-0" A.F.F.
- Actual vestibule wall height must be verified to determine shop drawing requirement
- Wall thickness increase of 2.375" requires coordination with doors, glazing, and MEP systems
- Aluminum frames/glazing reduction provides offsetting credit but scope undefined
- Incomplete visual documentation (missing 3 of 4 images) limits full analysis

**Critical Path:**
1. Obtain Clarification 2445-05
2. Verify vestibule wall heights
3. Determine P.Eng shop drawing requirement
4. Complete coordination review
5. Submit pricing with schedule impact

**Recommendation:** This change should not proceed to pricing until wall heights are verified and Clarification 2445-05 is reviewed to understand full scope. The potential requirement for P.Eng sealed shop drawings could add 3-6 weeks to the schedule, which must be factored into the Change Order negotiation.
