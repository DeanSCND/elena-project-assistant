## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Resolved Conflicts
1. **Original Breaker Sizing Error**:
   - **Issue**: Initial drawings specified 15A-2P (two-pole) breaker
   - **Root Cause**: Equipment is single-phase 120V, not requiring two-pole breaker
   - **Resolution**: PCN #33 corrects to 15A-1P breaker
   - **Impact**: Avoids unnecessary two-pole breaker installation and incorrect voltage supply

### Potential Coordination Items

1. **GFCI Circuit Compatibility**:
   - **Critical**: If facility has GFCI circuits, machine MUST be wired for 208V
   - **Action Required**: Electrical contractor to verify GFCI presence before equipment order
   - **Risk**: 115V machines are incompatible with GFCI circuits

2. **Equipment Location Verification**:
   - **Note**: Drawing E2.2 shows equipment location as B-13 in Bakery Prep (Room 130)
   - **Coordination**: Exact location requires confirmation with approved equipment package
   - **Per Drawing Notes**: "Contractor to confirm exact quantities and locations with approved equipment package and plan"

3. **Mounting Height Confirmation**:
   - **Requirement**: Electrical contractor to confirm mounting heights prior to rough-in
   - **Receptacle/Connection**: Floor-mounted equipment on casters (mobile unit)
   - **Connection Point**: Likely floor-mounted or wall-mounted disconnect/receptacle

4. **Equipment Clearances**:
   - **Machine Footprint**: 60" length (up to 72" extended) × 29" width
   - **Mobile**: Unit on casters, requires clearance for movement
   - **Coordination**: Verify adequate space in Bakery Prep room with architectural/millwork

5. **Load Confirmation**:
   - **Per Drawing Note #2**: "Electrical contractor to confirm all equipment loads, circuit sizes, and mounting heights prior to rough-in"
   - **Final Verification**: Wire and connect per final nameplate of equipment

## 11. Technical Analysis & Recommendations

### Electrical Design Validation
**Assessment**: The revision from 15A-2P to 15A-1P is correct and appropriate.

**Justification**:
- Equipment is single-phase 120V or 208V (both single-phase options)
- Two-pole breaker not required for single-phase loads in this application
- Single-pole 15A breaker provides adequate overcurrent protection for 15A load
- Wire size (#12 AWG) is appropriately rated for 15A circuit

### GFCI Consideration Critical
**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Issue**: Manufacturer explicitly states 115V machines are incompatible with GFCI circuits.

**Recommendation**:
1. Determine GFCI requirements for bakery prep area per local code authority
2. If GFCI protection required, specify 208V equipment configuration
3. Document decision and coordination with equipment supplier
4. Include in submittal review process

### Load Analysis
- **Connected Load**: 15A @ 120V = 1,800 VA
- **Motor HP**: 3/4 HP ≈ 560W running load
- **Margin**: Adequate safety factor for motor starting current
- **Panel Capacity**: Panel 'B' is 200A panel, single 15A circuit has minimal impact on panel loading

### Installation Considerations
1. **Mobile Equipment**: Caster-mounted unit requires flexible connection or floor-mounted receptacle
2. **Workspace**: 60"-72" length requires verification against room dimensions
3. **Catch Tray**: Extended catch tray adds 12" to overall length during operation
4. **Adjacency**: Coordinate with other bakery equipment (mixers, ovens, proofers) for workflow
