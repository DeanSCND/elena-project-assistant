## 1. VISUAL INTERPRETATION

### Plan View Drawing Analysis

The accompanying image (page001_img003.jpeg) shows a detailed architectural plan view of the compressor mezzanine stair area with the following visual elements:

#### Color Coding
- **Yellow highlighting**: Indicates the proposed new Wall Type A2 location - prominently highlighted along the side of Stairs #2
- **Blue hexagonal pattern**: Appears to represent equipment or mechanical units positioned above/on the mezzanine level (shown with circular repeated pattern)
- **Orange/tan lines**: Represent mechanical piping and equipment (visible on the right side of the drawing)
- **Black lines**: Standard architectural elements including walls, columns, and stair treads
- **Dashed lines**: Grid lines and reference lines

#### Spatial Layout
- **Stairs #2**: Clearly labeled with "STAIRS #2" text, showing stair treads in plan view with standard stair symbols
- **Direction indicator**: "UP" arrow shown at base of stairs indicating stair direction
- **Column locations**: Structural columns marked with crossed symbols (⊗) at both ends of the proposed wall
- **Grid reference**: Circular grid marker "2" visible on the left side of the drawing
- **Column references**: "C3" column markers shown with dimensional callouts (9'-3" and 8'-8" spacing visible)

#### Wall Location
- The proposed Wall Type A2 (highlighted in yellow) is positioned:
  - Between two structural columns
  - Along the east side of Stairs #2
  - Below the mezzanine level
  - Parallel to the stair run

#### Equipment Context
- Mechanical equipment shown in blue hexagonal pattern positioned on/above mezzanine
- Mechanical piping (orange) runs adjacent to the stair area
- Equipment appears to be compressor units based on the PCN title and visual representation

## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Coordination Concerns

#### 1. Handrail Attachment
- **Issue**: The wall is specifically noted as "to receive handrail" but no handrail details or shop drawings are referenced
- **Coordination needed**: Ensure handrail attachment details are compatible with 3 5/8" steel stud wall construction
- **Blocking requirement**: May require additional blocking or reinforcement within wall for handrail attachment points

#### 2. Mechanical Equipment Clearances
- **Observation**: Blue hexagonal pattern equipment (likely compressors) positioned above/near stair area
- **Consideration**: Verify that new wall doesn't impact access for equipment maintenance or replacement
- **Service clearance**: Confirm HVAC/refrigeration service clearances maintained per code

#### 3. Column Interface
- **Detail needed**: Connection detail between steel stud wall and structural columns not shown
- **Track attachment**: Method of attaching wall tracks to columns requires coordination with structural engineer

#### 4. Fire Rating
- **Unknown**: No fire rating specified for Wall Type A2
- **Code concern**: Wall adjacent to stairs may require fire-rated assembly depending on building/exit requirements
- **Clarification needed**: Verify if fire rating is specified in wall type schedule

#### 5. Mezzanine Structure Interface
- **Location**: Wall terminates "below mezzanine" - exact height and attachment to mezzanine structure unclear
- **Detail needed**: Top-of-wall connection to underside of mezzanine deck

#### 6. Stair Code Compliance
- **Observation**: Wall adds enclosure to one side of Stairs #2
- **Code check**: Verify stair width requirements maintained with new wall
- **Egress**: Confirm stair still meets exit requirements if serving as egress path

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Building Code Considerations

#### Stair Requirements
- **IBC/NBC Chapter 10 (Means of Egress)**:
  - Verify minimum stair width maintained (typically 44" for egress stairs, 36" minimum for accessory stairs)
  - Confirm handrail extends required length along stair run
  - Handrail height requirements: 34"-38" above stair nosing
  - Handrail must be continuous along full length of stair flight

#### Handrail Specifications (Code Requirements)
- **Graspability**: Circular cross-section 1.25" to 2" diameter OR perimeter 4" to 6.25"
- **Clearance**: Minimum 1.5" clear from wall surface to handrail
- **Structural**: Must withstand 200 lb concentrated load or 50 lb/linear foot
- **Returns**: Handrail ends must return to wall or terminate at newel post

#### Guard Requirements
- **Height**: If mezzanine elevation creates fall hazard >30", guards required at 42" minimum height
- **Consideration**: Verify if wall location relates to guard/guardrail requirements at mezzanine edge

#### Wall Construction
- **Fire Rating**: Verify if wall requires fire-resistance rating based on:
  - Proximity to exit stair
  - Separation from equipment room
  - Building construction type classification
- **Smoke barriers**: Confirm if wall is part of smoke compartmentation

#### Accessibility (AODA/ADA)
- **Handrail requirement**: If Stairs #2 serves accessible route, specific handrail requirements apply
- **Extensions**: Handrails must extend 12" beyond top/bottom risers at consistent height

#### Mechanical Code
- **Equipment access**: Verify compressor equipment maintains required service clearances
- **Working space**: Equipment may require 30" minimum working clearance (verify with mechanical code)

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

### Information Needed from Design Team
1. **Wall Type A2 Details**: Provide wall type schedule showing:
   - Fire rating (if applicable)
   - Finish materials both sides
   - Stud spacing and gauge
   - Insulation requirements
   - Base and top-of-wall conditions

2. **Handrail Details**: Provide:
   - Handrail profile and material
   - Mounting bracket specifications
   - Blocking locations within wall
   - Handrail start/stop points

3. **Connection Details**: Provide:
   - Wall-to-column connection detail
   - Top-of-wall attachment to mezzanine structure
   - Base-of-wall condition (floor attachment)

4. **Dimensional Verification**: Confirm:
   - Exact wall length between columns
   - Wall height (floor to underside of mezzanine)
   - Resulting stair width after wall installation

5. **Coordination Drawings**: Request:
   - Updated mechanical plan showing equipment clearances
   - Reflected ceiling plan if applicable
   - Structural confirmation of column attachment capacity

## 9. CRITICAL PATH CONSIDERATIONS

### Dependencies
- Wall type details must be finalized before framing can proceed
- Handrail blocking locations must be coordinated before wall closing
- Structural engineer review of column attachment required
- Code review for fire rating may impact material selection and cost

### Schedule Impact
- Relatively minor scope addition
- Could be executed during normal construction sequence
- No major long-lead items identified
- Coordinate with handrail fabrication/procurement

---

## 10. COST IMPACT FACTORS

### Scope Additions
- Steel stud framing material (3 5/8" studs, tracks, fasteners)
- Wall finish materials per Type A2 specification
- Labor for framing and finishing
- Additional blocking for handrail support
- Connection hardware for column attachment

### Potential Additional Costs
- Fire-rated assembly if required (rated studs, drywall, fire caulking)
- Handrail (if not already in base scope)
- Engineering review fees for connection details
- Testing/inspection if fire-rated assembly
