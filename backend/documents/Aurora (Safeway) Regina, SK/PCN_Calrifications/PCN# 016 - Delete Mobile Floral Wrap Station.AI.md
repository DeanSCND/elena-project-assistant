## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Accessibility Considerations:
**NOTE**: While this is a deletion, owner should be aware:
- Mobile stations must still comply with accessibility requirements when installed
- Counter height, reach ranges, and clearances must meet applicable codes
- If station has lockable doors or controls, they must be accessible

### Plumbing/Mechanical (If Applicable):
**VERIFY**:
- If station requires plumbing connections (visible blue element on plan suggests possible water connection):
  - Backflow prevention may be required
  - Drainage must meet plumbing code
  - Water supply must be properly sized and protected
- Owner installation must meet same code requirements as contractor work

### Electrical (If Applicable):
**VERIFY**:
- If station requires electrical connections:
  - Owner must ensure licensed electrician performs work
  - Connections must meet electrical code
  - GFCI protection may be required depending on location and use

### Fire & Life Safety:
**LOW CONCERN**:
- Mobile station unlikely to create fire-rated assembly penetrations
- Ensure station location doesn't block egress or exit access
- Verify station doesn't obstruct fire protection equipment (sprinklers, fire extinguishers, etc.)

### Building Permit Coordination:
**IMPORTANT**:
- Verify if deletion requires permit amendment or revision submission
- Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) noted on PCN must be informed
- Owner installation may require separate permit depending on local requirements
- Coordinate with AHJ on inspection requirements for owner-installed work

### Structural:
**LOW CONCERN**:
- Mobile/caster-mounted station has minimal structural impact
- Verify floor loading is adequate for owner-supplied unit
- Lavergne Draward & Associates Inc. (structural engineer) is on distribution list
