## 3. CHANGE DESCRIPTION

**What is being changed:**
The electrical circuit breaker size and wire gauge for the refrigeration gas cooler are being increased.

**Original Specification:**
- 20A-3P (3-pole) circuit breaker
- #12 AWG wire
- Fed from 347/600V-3PH electrical panel '100A'

**Revised Specification:**
- 25A-3P (3-pole) circuit breaker
- #10 AWG wire
- Fed from 347/600V-3PH electrical panel '100A'

**Reason for Change:**
Not explicitly stated, but typical reasons include:
- Actual gas cooler equipment load exceeds original calculation
- Manufacturer's specifications require larger circuit
- Voltage drop calculations require larger wire size
- Code compliance or safety factor requirements
- Equipment substitution with higher electrical demand

**Scope of Impact:**
- Affects electrical panel '100A' schedule (Drawing E0.2)
- Requires larger circuit breaker and wire gauge
- May affect conduit sizing if not already installed
- Potential cost increase for materials

## 4. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Equipment/Materials Affected:**
- Refrigeration Gas Cooler (heat rejection equipment for CO2 refrigeration system)

**Electrical Characteristics:**
- **Voltage:** 347/600V-3PH (three-phase, high voltage)
- **Original Circuit:** 20A-3P breaker with #12 wire
- **Revised Circuit:** 25A-3P breaker with #10 wire
- **Percentage Increase:** 25% increase in breaker rating

**Panel Location:**
- Panel '100A' (347/600V-3PH)
- Per PCN #063 page 3 schedule, Panel 100A is surface mounted in West Staff Corridor

**Wire Sizing:**
- **#12 AWG:** Typically rated 20A at 75°C terminations
- **#10 AWG:** Typically rated 30A at 75°C terminations
- Using 25A breaker with #10 wire provides appropriate safety margin

**Referenced Drawings:**
- **E0.2** – Schedules (electrical panel schedules)

## 5. CROSS-REFERENCES

**Related Drawings:**
- Electrical Drawing E0.2 – Schedules (shows panel '100A' schedule that must be updated)
- Likely also affects power distribution drawings showing gas cooler location

**Related Systems:**
- Refrigeration system (gas cooler is part of CO2 refrigeration heat rejection)
- HVAC coordination (gas cooler typically located on roof or exterior)
- Mechanical drawings showing gas cooler location and connection

**Other PCNs Referenced:**
None directly referenced, but likely related to:
- Any refrigeration system PCNs
- Mechanical equipment changes

**Systems/Disciplines Affected:**
- **Electrical (Primary):** Power distribution, panel schedules
- **Mechanical:** Refrigeration system coordination
- **Structural:** Verify conduit routing if changes required

## 6. COORDINATION NOTES

**Trades Involved:**
1. **Electrical Contractor:** Primary responsibility for circuit upgrade
2. **Refrigeration Contractor:** Coordinate gas cooler specifications and connection requirements
3. **General Contractor:** Schedule coordination

**Potential Conflicts with Other Work:**
- If conduit is already installed with #12 wire, may need to be pulled and replaced
- Verify panel '100A' has capacity for 25A breaker (rather than 20A)
- Check if panel bus bar rating accommodates the increased load
- Confirm conduit fill calculations still comply with code for #10 wire

**Sequence Dependencies:**
1. Update electrical drawings (E0.2 panel schedule)
2. Verify panel '100A' capacity and available breaker positions
3. Procure 25A-3P breaker and #10 wire
4. Install or replace wire in conduit
5. Install breaker in panel
6. Test and verify proper operation
7. Update as-built drawings

**Critical Coordination Points:**
- **Gas Cooler Location:** Typically roof-mounted for CO2 refrigeration systems
- **Wire Routing:** Verify conduit path from panel '100A' in West Staff Corridor to gas cooler location
- **Panel Capacity:** Confirm panel '100A' has adequate capacity for increased load
- **Voltage Drop:** Engineer likely increased wire size to meet voltage drop requirements for long runs to roof
- **Manufacturer Coordination:** Verify gas cooler nameplate data matches revised circuit size

## 7. COST/SCHEDULE IMPACT

**Cost Impact:**
Not specified in PCN. Cost increase expected due to:
- Larger circuit breaker (25A vs 20A) - relatively minor cost
- Larger wire gauge (#10 vs #12) - moderate cost increase, especially for long runs
- Labor to replace wire if already installed - potentially significant
- Potential conduit upsizing if required

Contractor (Quorex Construction Services Ltd.) required to submit signed letter with:
- Price including cost breakdown
- Any change to construction schedule

**Schedule Impact:**
- **Minimal** if caught before wire installation
- **Moderate** if wire must be pulled and replaced
- Depends on material availability for 25A breakers and #10 wire

**Estimated Material Cost Difference:**
- #10 AWG vs #12 AWG: approximately 40-60% cost increase per linear foot
- For a typical roof run (e.g., 100-200 feet), could be several hundred dollars material difference
- 25A breaker vs 20A breaker: minimal difference ($50-150)

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Gas Cooler Context:**
A gas cooler is a critical component in transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems (which Aurora Food Store likely uses for environmental sustainability). The gas cooler:
- Rejects heat from the refrigeration system to outdoor air
- Operates at high pressure (supercritical CO2 conditions)
- Requires fans and controls (hence the electrical load)
- Typically located on roof or exterior wall
- Is part of modern low-GWP (Global Warming Potential) refrigeration technology

**Three-Phase 347/600V System:**
- This is a Canadian high-voltage system (not common in USA)
- 347V phase-to-neutral, 600V phase-to-phase
- Typically used for larger motors and HVAC equipment
- Requires special equipment rated for this voltage
- Common in commercial/industrial applications in Canada

**Wire Sizing Analysis:**
The upgrade from #12 to #10 wire suggests:
1. **Load increase:** Gas cooler draws more current than originally specified
2. **Voltage drop:** Long run distance requires larger wire to maintain proper voltage
3. **Temperature rating:** Ambient conditions or conduit fill may require derating
4. **Future capacity:** May provide margin for future equipment changes

**Code Compliance:**
Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) requires:
- Wire ampacity must be ≥ breaker rating
- #10 AWG (30A rating) with 25A breaker = compliant with 80% continuous load rule
- Voltage drop should not exceed 3% for branch circuits (5% total)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW RISK** - Standard electrical upgrade
- **COST IMPACT** - Moderate if wire not yet installed, higher if replacement required
- **SCHEDULE IMPACT** - Minimal with proper planning

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify current installation status (is wire already pulled?)
2. If not installed, proceed with #10 wire and 25A breaker
3. If installed, assess cost/schedule impact of replacement
4. Verify panel '100A' capacity
5. Update panel schedule drawing E0.2
6. Coordinate with refrigeration contractor on gas cooler specifications
7. Verify conduit size accommodates #10 wire (should be adequate if sized per code)
8. Update electrical load calculations for panel '100A'
