## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts

**1. Mechanical Equipment Coordination**
- **Issue**: Upgraded wall assembly from A4b to A4d increases wall thickness
- **Impact**: Potential reduction in room clear dimensions
- **Affected Areas**:
  - Compressor Room (300) with 6'-4" width may be constrained
  - Equipment clearances (3'-8", 3'-10", 3'-11") may be impacted
- **Recommendation**: Verify all equipment clearances still meet manufacturer requirements and code minimums after wall thickness increase

**2. Door/Opening Coordination**
- **Issue**: Wall type change may affect door frame types and fire ratings
- **Impact**: All doors penetrating A4d walls must maintain 1-hour FRR
- **Recommendation**: Coordinate with door schedule to ensure all doors in these walls are rated appropriately

**3. Penetrations Through FRR Walls**
- **Issue**: Any MEP penetrations (HVAC ducts, piping, electrical conduit) through 1-hour FRR walls require fire-stopping
- **Visible Concerns**: Refrigeration piping and electrical services to compressor room
- **Recommendation**: Coordinate with MEP consultants (CGM Engineering) to:
  - Identify all penetrations through upgraded walls
  - Specify appropriate fire-stopping systems
  - Detail penetration locations and firestopping assemblies

**4. Structural Coordination**
- **Issue**: Increased dead load from 5/8" Type-X gypsum board vs. 1/2" standard board
- **Weight Difference**: Approximately 0.5-0.8 psf increase per wall face
- **Impact**: Mezzanine structure supporting these walls
- **Recommendation**: Verify with structural engineer that mezzanine framing can support additional load

**5. Stair Enclosure Coordination**
- **Issue**: Stair area (300A) connection to compressor room
- **Question**: Does the stair require fire separation from compressor room or is it part of the same fire compartment?
- **Recommendation**: Clarify fire compartment boundaries and stair enclosure requirements with code consultant

### Consistency Checks Needed

**Wall Assembly Details**
- Verify wall type A4d detail exists in architectural drawings
- Confirm A4d assembly achieves 1-hour FRR (should be UL/ULC tested assembly)
- Verify all components: studs, insulation, gypsum board on both sides

**Fire Extinguisher Locations**
- Four fire extinguishers shown with "A-4d" callouts (may be coincidental to wall type notation)
- Verify fire extinguisher type and spacing meets code requirements for refrigeration machinery room

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Fire Resistance Rating (FRR) Requirements

**Building Code Context:**
- **Occupancy**: Food store with mezzanine refrigeration machinery room
- **Requirement**: 1-hour fire resistance rating for compressor room enclosure
- **Compliance Method**: Upgrading wall assembly from A4b to A4d with Type-X gypsum board

**NBC (National Building Code of Canada) References:**
- **Section 3.6**: Refrigeration machinery rooms typically require fire separation
- **Section 3.1.3**: Fire compartments and fire separations
- **Possible Classification**: Refrigeration machinery room may be classified as high hazard industrial occupancy (Group F, Division 2) requiring separation from retail occupancy

### Type-X Gypsum Board Requirements

**Specification:**
- **Material**: 5/8" Type-X (fire-rated) gypsum board
- **Standard**: Must meet ASTM C1396/CAN/CSA-A82.27-M
- **Performance**: Type-X provides additional fire resistance through glass fiber reinforcement and special core additives
- **Installation**: Must be installed per manufacturer specifications and tested assembly requirements

**1-Hour FRR Wall Assembly Components:**
- Gypsum board on both sides of wall
- Appropriate stud spacing and gauge
- Fire-rated insulation (if required by assembly)
- Proper fastening pattern and spacing
- Sealed penetrations with fire-stopping

### Penetration Protection

**Code Requirements:**
- All penetrations through 1-hour FRR walls must maintain fire rating
- **NBC Article 3.1.9**: Fire stops and continuity of fire separations
- **Firestopping Systems**: Must be tested and listed (ULC-S115 in Canada)
- **Common Penetrations in Compressor Rooms:**
  - Refrigerant piping (multiple sizes)
  - Electrical conduit and cables
  - HVAC ductwork (if applicable)
  - Control wiring

### Fire Extinguisher Requirements

**Refrigeration Machinery Rooms:**
- Portable fire extinguishers required
- **NFPA/NBC**: Typically Class B/C extinguishers for electrical and flammable refrigerant hazards
- **Spacing**: Maximum 75 feet travel distance to extinguisher
- Four locations shown appear to provide adequate coverage

### Ventilation Requirements

**Refrigeration Machinery Room Ventilation:**
- **B52 (Refrigeration Code)**: Mechanical ventilation required
- **Emergency Ventilation**: May be required for refrigerant leak detection
- **Impact of FRR Upgrade**: Ensure ventilation openings/ducts maintain fire separation
- **Coordination**: Verify with CGM Engineering that ventilation design accommodates 1-hour FRR walls

### Egress and Life Safety

**Stair Access (300A):**
- 3'-7" opening width should be verified against minimum egress width
- **NBC 3.4**: Egress width requirements
- If this is the only exit from mezzanine, may require additional egress analysis
- Stair may require 1-hour FRR enclosure depending on building height and area

### Mechanical Code Compliance

**CSA B52 (Mechanical Refrigeration Code):**
- Compressor room must be separated from occupied spaces
- Adequate ventilation for refrigerant safety
- Emergency controls and shut-offs
- Refrigerant detection system (if required by refrigerant type and quantity)
- **Machine room classification** based on refrigerant charge and type

---

## 6. PROCUREMENT & COST IMPLICATIONS

### Material Changes
- **From**: 1/2" standard gypsum board
- **To**: 5/8" Type-X gypsum board
- **Cost Impact**: Type-X gypsum board typically 20-30% more expensive than standard
- **Additional Materials**: May require longer screws for increased thickness

### Labor Impact
- Heavier material (5/8" vs 1/2") increases installation time
- Type-X board is more brittle, requires more care in handling
- Fire-stopping of penetrations adds labor and material cost

### Schedule Impact
- PCN dated August 20, 2025
- Change should be implemented before wall framing/drywall installation
- If walls already installed with A4b, demolition and reinstallation required

## 10. SUMMARY

This PCN modifies the compressor room enclosure on the mezzanine level to achieve 1-hour fire resistance rating by upgrading the wall assembly from type A4b (1/2" standard gypsum board) to type A4d (5/8" Type-X gypsum board). The change affects all interior walls of the compressor room as highlighted in yellow on the plan.

Critical coordination is required with MEP disciplines to ensure all penetrations are properly fire-stopped, and with structural to verify the mezzanine can support the additional load. All doors in these walls must also be upgraded to 1-hour rated assemblies to maintain fire compartment integrity.

The change is necessary for building code compliance regarding separation of refrigeration machinery rooms from adjacent occupied spaces.
