## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Spatial Coordination Issues

**1. Equipment Clearance Conflicts**:
- **Baler Position**: Notation specifies "shifted baler by the staircase with a 2' clearance" - requires verification that egress from Stairs #2 is not compromised
- **Stacker Jack**: "Relocated stacker jack between the baler and recycle room" - tight spacing may create material handling conflicts
- **Power Jack Chargers**: Wall-mounted relocation needs coordination with wall construction and electrical rough-in

**2. Vertical Coordination**:
- **Compressor Room Mezzanine**: "Line of compressor room mezzanine above" notation indicates overhead structure above receiving area - potential conflict with:
  - Equipment heights (compactor, baler)
  - Material handling clearances
  - Lighting and sprinkler locations
- **Compactor Pad Elevation**: 4" raised pad requires coordination with:
  - Floor drainage patterns
  - Adjacent equipment accessibility
  - Truck loading dock interface

**3. Access and Egress**:
- Multiple equipment pieces in receiving area may restrict circulation
- CAO desk "positioned by the man door" - needs verification that emergency egress is maintained
- Revision notes indicate "removal of 2 exterior doors" and "added 1 exterior door" - building code compliance for egress must be verified

### Electrical Coordination Issues

**1. Circuit Loading**:
- CAO desk added to circuit C1-22, which also serves a relocated housekeeping receptacle
- Electrical PCN #12 indicates "One(1) housekeeping receptacle is shifted ~7' to make room for the CAO receiving desk"
- Need to verify circuit C1-22 capacity for additional loads

**2. Power Routing**:
- Wall-mounted power jack chargers require new conduit routing
- Note 36 requires "junction box, conduit, wiring and connection for compactor, dock leveller, and overhead door"
- Underground conduit routing must avoid walk-in box door swing areas (General Note 2)

**3. Equipment Power Requirements**:
- Garbage power pack is new addition - power requirements not explicitly stated in PCN
- Compactor power connection method needs clarification (direct connection vs receptacle)

### Mechanical/Plumbing Coordination

**1. Floor Drains**:
- Floor drains shown on plan near equipment areas
- Compactor pad at 4" higher elevation may affect drainage patterns
- Coordination needed with floor slope requirements

**2. Waste Management System**:
- Garbage chute, compactor, and power pack must align functionally
- Baler position change affects cardboard collection workflow
- Distance to exterior collection points needs verification

**3. HVAC**:
- Receiving area equipment generates heat (compactor, baler motors)
- Ventilation requirements for waste handling areas
- Emergency condensing unit location affects airflow patterns

### Fixture Plan Discrepancies

**1. Revision Timing**:
- PCN dated August 13, 2025 references:
  - Electrical PCN #12 dated August 11, 2025
  - Fixture Plan FP.R05 dated August 7, 2025
  - Fixture Plan FP.R04 dated July 23, 2025
- **Potential Issue**: FP.R05 predates Electrical PCN #12, suggesting possible coordination gap

**2. Drawing Coordination**:
- Architectural PCN references electrical changes, but timing suggests electrical design may have evolved after fixture plan was issued
- CAO desk shown on fixture plan with power/data requirements that are addressed in electrical PCN #12

**3. Equipment Supplier Coordination**:
- Multiple notes require "confirm exact requirements with" various suppliers
- "Vendor supplied" equipment (floor washing machine) shown on plan without confirmed dimensions
- General Note 15: "Verify exact location of all stub-up locations with owner's representative, refrigeration contractor and fixture/equipment supplier prior to rough-in"

### Structural Coordination

**1. Compactor Pad**:
- 4" raised concrete pad requires structural analysis for loading
- Compactor dynamic loads (compression cycle) need engineering review
- Foundation details not shown on this PCN

**2. Floor Loading**:
- 15 pallet staging area represents significant live load
- Baler and compactor equipment weights plus operational loads
- Floor washing machines (2 units) storage and operation

**3. Mezzanine Interface**:
- Compressor room mezzanine structure over receiving area
- Column locations affect equipment placement
- Note 12: "All conduit in sales area columns must be mounted on the backside (facing rear of store)"

### Code Compliance Concerns

**1. Egress**:
- Equipment relocation in receiving area may affect exit access
- Multiple notes reference emergency exits with "TBC" (To Be Confirmed) status
- Travel distances to exits need verification with equipment in new positions

**2. Accessibility**:
- CAO receiving desk must meet accessibility requirements
- Work surface heights and clearances need verification
- "Forward approach" dimensions noted on other areas of plan

**3. Fire Protection**:
- Sprinkler coverage with new equipment layout
- Fire separation requirements for compressor room mezzanine
- Fire suppression for cooking hood areas (different zone, but precedent for coordination)

2. **Structural Review**: Engineer to analyze compactor pad loading and mezzanine interface
3. **Electrical Capacity**: Verify panel C1 has adequate capacity for circuit C1-22 additional loads
4. **Coordination Meeting**: Convene GC, electrical, structural, and equipment suppliers to review final layout
5. **Cost/Schedule Impact**: Contractor to submit pricing and schedule analysis per PCN header requirements

### Design Clarifications Needed

1. **Garbage Power Pack**: Obtain manufacturer's specifications for power, dimensions, clearances
2. **Compactor Pad**: Structural details, reinforcement, connections to building
3. **CAO Desk**: Exact model, dimensions, and infrastructure requirements
4. **Wall Construction**: Confirm wall type for power jack charger mounting (load-bearing capacity)
5. **Egress Analysis**: Confirm exit access routes with equipment in final positions

### Construction Phase Coordination

1. **Schedule underground electrical before concrete pad**
2. **Coordinate mezzanine structure completion before receiving equipment installation**
3. **Sequence wall construction to allow charger mounting before finishes**
4. **Plan equipment delivery and rigging access**
5. **Coordinate operational testing with owner before substantial completion**

### Long-Term Considerations

1. **Maintenance Access**: Verify clearances adequate for future service
2. **Expansion Capability**: Consider future equipment additions or replacements
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Monitor workflow after occupancy for optimization opportunities
4. **Energy Efficiency**: Consider controls integration for waste management equipment
