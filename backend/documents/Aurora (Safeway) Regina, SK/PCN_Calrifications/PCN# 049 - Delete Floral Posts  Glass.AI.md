- Various millwork elements including:
  - 10" clear space marked (DBC)
  - Shelving below notation
  - 12"D glass shelving above notation
  - Drawer units
  - 6" backsplash

**Color Coding:**
- Yellow/orange highlighting on the glazing element to be deleted - clearly identifying the scope of deletion
- Black line work for standard floor plan elements
- Dashed lines indicating overhead elements or shelving

**Spatial Layout:**
- Floral prep area positioned adjacent to wrapping/staging area
- Curved counter configuration approximately 82'-8" (based on dimension visible)
- Integration with cash drawer location
- Connection to customer-facing service area

  - Interior finish plans
  - Floral department layouts

### Related Documentation
- Original construction drawings showing floral millwork details
- Millwork shop drawings (if previously submitted)
- Interior elevations of floral prep area

### Project References

## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Coordination Items

**Millwork Coordination:**
- Deletion of posts and glass will leave countertop with fastening holes/attachment points
- Countertop surface treatment at deletion area needs clarification
- May require patching or filling of mounting points
- Visual appearance of counter edge where posts were attached

**Design Intent Questions:**
- Purpose of original glass barrier (sneeze guard, display separation, etc.)
- Impact on floral department functionality without barrier
- Health code or food safety implications if this was a barrier between prep and customer areas

**Scope Clarification Needed:**
- Does deletion include removal of mounting hardware?
- Surface repair/finishing of countertop included in credit?
- Any touch-up or refinishing of millwork required?

### No Apparent Conflicts With:
- Structural elements
- Mechanical/electrical systems (none shown in affected area)
- Fire/life safety systems

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Health & Safety Considerations
- **Food Safety**: If this glazing served as a sneeze guard or barrier for food prep area, deletion may require:
  - Health authority approval
  - Alternative protective measures
  - Compliance with local health codes for food retail

- **Accessibility**: No apparent accessibility code impacts from deletion

### Building Code Items
- **Glass/Glazing**: Deletion removes glazing, so no safety glazing requirements apply
- **Guards/Barriers**: At 12" height, this was not a code-required guard

### Authority Having Jurisdiction
- PCN specifically notes: "Authority having Jurisdiction shall advise of any objections"
- Health inspector review recommended before proceeding
- Confirm no retail food code requirements for barriers in floral prep areas

---

## 6. COST & SCHEDULE IMPLICATIONS

### Credit Request
- PCN Section 1.0.2 explicitly requests: "Provide credit"
- Contractor to submit:
  - Signed letter with price
  - Cost breakdown
  - Change (if any) to construction schedule

### Scope of Credit Should Include
- Glass panels (12" high)
- Posts/mounting hardware
- Installation labor
- Fasteners/attachments to countertop
- Any associated trim or finishing

### Schedule Impact
- Likely minimal - deletion typically accelerates schedule
- May depend on millwork fabrication status
- If millwork already fabricated, credit may be reduced

## 8. ACTION ITEMS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Required Contractor Actions
1. Submit signed letter with pricing and cost breakdown
2. Provide credit amount for deleted scope
3. Advise if any schedule impact (likely acceleration)
4. Confirm millwork fabrication status

### Recommended Clarifications
1. **Surface Treatment**: Specify repair/finishing of countertop where posts were attached
2. **Health Code Review**: Confirm deletion acceptable to health authority
3. **Functional Impact**: Document owner's acceptance of functionality change
4. **Millwork Status**: Confirm whether millwork already fabricated/ordered
5. **Scope Verification**: Confirm removal of all mounting hardware included

### Design Team Considerations
- Update architectural millwork drawings to reflect deletion
- Issue revised floral area elevations/plans
- Coordinate with millwork shop drawings (if issued)
- Update finish schedules if affected

## 9. SUMMARY

This PCN deletes a 12" high glass barrier with posts from the curved section of the Floral Prep Area countertop. The deletion appears straightforward from a construction standpoint but should be reviewed for health code compliance, particularly if the glazing served as a sneeze guard or food safety barrier. A credit is requested for the deleted scope. The change impacts architectural millwork only, with no apparent structural, mechanical, or electrical coordination required.

**Risk Level**: Low to Medium (pending health authority review)
**Complexity**: Simple deletion
**Primary Concern**: Health code compliance for food retail areas
