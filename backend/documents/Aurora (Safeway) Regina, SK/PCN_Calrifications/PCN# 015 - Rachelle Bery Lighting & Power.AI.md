## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Coordination Conflicts

**1. Decor Package Replacement Timing**
- **Issue**: PCN requires replacement of all decor drawings with R02 revision dated April 28, 2025
- **Concern**: Contractors may have been working from previous decor package revisions
- **Impact**: Potential rework if earlier decor drawings showed different Rachelle Bery configurations
- **Recommendation**: Verify no work commenced on Rachelle Bery area using outdated decor drawings

**2. Spare Circuit Allocation**
- **Issue**: Circuit 2L-2 was previously designated as "SPARE" and is now being allocated
- **Concern**: Loss of spare capacity on Panel 2L
- **Current Panel 2L Status**: After this change, circuits 2L-3 and 2L-5 remain as spares (only 2 spares remaining on 42-circuit panel)
- **Recommendation**: Consider future capacity needs for sales area lighting modifications

**3. Receptacle Mounting Coordination**
- **Issue**: Note 36 requires receptacles "mounted behind light box"
- **Concerns**:
  - Requires precise coordination with millwork installation
  - Access for maintenance may be limited
  - Exact mounting height/location dependent on manufacturer's literature
- **Dependencies**: Rachelle Bery design package and manufacturer's cut sheets must be available before rough-in
- **Recommendation**: Hold electrical rough-in in this area until millwork details are confirmed

**4. Light Box Power Cord Configuration**
- **Issue**: No specification provided for receptacle type (standard duplex, single, twist-lock, etc.)
- **Concern**: Light box equipment cord configuration not confirmed in PCN
- **Impact**: May require field modification if receptacle type doesn't match equipment
- **Recommendation**: Verify with Rachelle Bery manufacturer whether standard 15A 120V duplex receptacles are suitable or if specialty receptacles required

**5. Circuit Loading Analysis**
- **Issue**: No load calculations provided for new fixtures or receptacles
- **Panel 2A Status**: Now utilizing circuits through position 38 of 42 available positions (4 spaces remaining)
- **Panel 2L Status**: Circuit 2L-2 now active for Type RB fixtures (load not specified)
- **Recommendation**: Verify panel capacity adequate for additions (though likely minimal load for LED fixtures and light box receptacles)

**6. Fire Alarm/Life Safety Coordination**
- **Note**: Sales area modifications near checkout and egress paths
- **Consideration**: Verify new fixtures don't obstruct egress signage or emergency lighting
- **Code Reference**: Per general notes, all installations must maintain CEC compliance
- **Recommendation**: Confirm emergency lighting coverage remains adequate with new fixture layout

**7. Lighting Control Integration**
- **Issue**: New Type RB fixtures on circuit 2L-2 must integrate with Zone 5 lighting controls
- **Zone 5 Description**: "120V SALES AREA TRACK AND BULKHEAD LIGHTING - EMS TIMECLOCK"
- **Concern**: EMS programming must be updated to include new fixtures
- **Coordination**: Micro Thermo West must program new circuit into control system
- **Recommendation**: Include EMS contractor in pre-installation coordination meeting

### Physical/Spatial Conflicts

**8. Structural Column Interference**
- **Observation**: Sales area shows numerous structural columns with conduit routing requirements
- **Note 12**: "All conduit in sales area columns must be mounted on the backside (facing rear of store)"
- **Concern**: New fixture/receptacle wiring may need to navigate around columns
- **Recommendation**: Field verify routing paths clear of architectural features before installation

**9. Ceiling Height/Fixture Mounting**
- **Issue**: Drawing shows "refer to architectural decor lighting and reflected ceiling plan for exact mounting heights"
- **Concern**: Sales area may have varying ceiling heights or bulkheads
- **Impact**: Fixture placement must accommodate ceiling conditions
- **Recommendation**: Site survey required before finalizing fixture locations

**10. Refrigeration/HVAC Coordination**
- **General Note**: Multiple references to coordinating with refrigeration contractor
- **Sales Area Proximity**: Rachelle Bery area near dairy cooler (133) and other refrigerated sections
- **Concern**: Conduit routing must avoid refrigeration piping and ductwork
- **Recommendation**: Review MEP coordination drawings before rough-in

## 10. RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Items
1. **Receptacle accessibility** - Mounting behind light box may create service access issues
2. **Manufacturer coordination** - Delay in receiving Rachelle Bery documentation could impact schedule
3. **Decor package changes** - R02 revision may introduce unforeseen conflicts with earlier work

### Medium Risk Items
1. **EMS programming** - Integration with existing control system requires specialized programming
2. **Millwork coordination** - Timing of electrical rough-in vs. millwork installation critical
3. **Panel capacity** - Limited spare circuits remaining on Panel 2A and 2L

### Low Risk Items
1. **Circuit loading** - Minimal load from LED fixtures and light box receptacles
2. **Code compliance** - Standard installation methods applicable
3. **Material availability** - Standard electrical materials readily available

---

## CONCLUSION

PCN #015 represents a straightforward electrical addition to support the Rachelle Bery department merchandising requirements. The scope is well-defined with clear electrical drawings and specifications. Key success factors include:

1. **Timely receipt** of Rachelle Bery manufacturer documentation
2. **Close coordination** with millwork contractor for receptacle concealment
3. **EMS system integration** for new lighting circuit
4. **Decor package R02 alignment** to ensure consistency with latest design intent

The electrical design appears code-compliant and properly engineered. The main coordination challenge is the receptacle mounting requirement behind light boxes, which demands precise field coordination. Contractor should request manufacturer cut sheets and confirm millwork installation sequence before proceeding with rough-in.

**Recommendation**: Approve PCN with conditions that manufacturer's literature and Rachelle Bery design package be provided prior to electrical rough-in in the affected area.
