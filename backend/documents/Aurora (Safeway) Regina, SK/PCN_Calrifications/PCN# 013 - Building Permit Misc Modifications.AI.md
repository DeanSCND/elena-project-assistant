## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Coordination Concerns

#### 1. Butcher Shop Wall and Handsink Relocation
**Issue**: New full-height wall addition (Type A2) requires relocation of existing handsink
**Trades affected**: Framing, plumbing, mechanical, FRP installation
**Coordination required**:
- Wall framing must be complete before plumbing rough-in
- FRP installation on Butcher side requires wall substrate ready
- Stainless steel cap fabrication requires exact wall terminus dimension
- Verify refrigerated case does not conflict with new wall location
- Handsink drain routing (MP-01D) shows complex path around existing GI and TD-1

**Recommendation**: Pre-construction meeting with framing, plumbing, and millwork trades to establish sequence and critical dimensions.

#### 2. Ceiling Type Change - Butcher Shop and Seafood Prep
**Issue**: Change from insulated cooler panel to T-bar/ACT system impacts multiple trades
**Trades affected**: Ceiling, HVAC, refrigeration, electrical, fire protection
**Coordination required**:
- Lighting fixtures changed from VT (vapor-tight?) to F1 (standard recessed?)
- Refrigeration coil locations must coordinate with new lighting layout (RCP Note 9)
- Sprinkler head locations need revision for T-bar grid
- HVAC diffuser/grille locations may need adjustment
- Structural support for T-bar system vs. panel system differs

**Credit items**: (10) VT fixtures removed, insulated panel system deleted
**Added items**: (10) F1 fixtures, T-bar and ACT installation

**Recommendation**: Update coordination drawings showing refrigeration coils, light fixtures, sprinklers, and diffusers in T-bar layout before rough-in.

#### 3. Staff Room Conversion - Storage #117 to Staff Break Room
**Issue**: Multiple new services added to existing space
**Trades affected**: Demolition, framing, plumbing, electrical, millwork
**Coordination required**:
- Furring wall at RWL must accommodate sink plumbing (3/4" hot/cold, 1½" vent, 2" drain)
- NHWH-1 (water heater) location and electrical connection
- Microwave dedicated 15A circuit rough-in before millwork
- Door deletion - verify wall continuity and finish transition
- New lighting fixture F1 location
- Drain routing (MP-01B) shows 2" line with 8" offset - verify no conflicts with slab or existing utilities

**Recommendation**: Verify all services can route through furring wall without conflicts. Confirm NHWH-1 model and clearance requirements.

#### 4. Meat Prep Cooler - Furring Wall Deletion
**Issue**: Surface-mounted piping creates potential freeze protection concern
**Trades affected**: Demolition, plumbing, insulation
**Coordination required**:
- Piping must be properly insulated per code for cooler environment
- Surface-mounted pipes may interfere with equipment or shelving
- Verify pipe support/hanger locations in cooler
- Credit for deleted furring wall and concealed piping

**Potential conflict**: Surface-mounted pipes more susceptible to damage in active prep area
**Recommendation**: Verify insulation specification meets code for cooler temperature. Consider protective guards if pipes are at risk of impact.

#### 5. ATM, Coinstar, and Food Bank Relocation
**Issue**: Multiple pieces of equipment relocated near checkout area
**Trades affected**: Electrical, data/communications, concrete (anchoring)
**Coordination required**:
- ATM requires dedicated 15A circuit and data conduit (1/2" EMT from IT Room)
- Coinstar requires dedicated 15A circuit (possibly existing location has receptacle)
- Water Dispenser requires dedicated 15A circuit
- Data conduit routing: IT Room to checkout area - verify path, length, and access
- Verify adequate panel capacity for new circuits
- Floor anchoring for all three units
- ADA clearances at ATM

**Drawing reference**: Page 2, image shows spatial layout with dimensions 4'-0", 16'-0", 4'-0", 2'+1½" between elements
**Recommendation**: Field verify final locations with owner before rough-in. Coordinate data conduit route to avoid conflicts with existing services.

#### 6. Barrier-Free Counter Modifications
**Issue**: Accessibility compliance requires precise dimensional control
**Trades affected**: Millwork, electrical (task lighting may be affected)
**Coordination required**:
- Customer Service Desk: 800mm min. knee space width, 685mm min. height, 865mm max. counter height
- Floral Desk: Same accessibility requirements
- Merchandiser slat wall below counters must maintain clearances
- Verify no equipment or utilities conflict with knee space volume
- Stainless steel countertop fabrication requires shop drawings

**Code compliance**: NBC accessibility requirements, Saskatchewan building code
**Recommendation**: Millwork shop drawings to be reviewed by Sobeys Design (Store Planner) and architect prior to fabrication. Field verify knee space is clear of obstructions during installation.

#### 7. Office Hallway Width Adjustment Below Staff Mezzanine
**Issue**: Dimensional change may affect egress width, door swings, or millwork
**Trades affected**: Framing, millwork, finishes
**Coordination required**:
- Verify adjusted width meets minimum egress requirements
- Check door swing clearances for adjacent offices (111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116)
- Mezzanine structure above - verify no impact to columns or beams
- Millwork or casework in hallway may need adjustment

**Missing information**: Specific dimension of width adjustment not clearly stated in PCN
**Recommendation**: Architect to provide dimensioned plan detail of adjusted hallway. Verify with code official that egress width is acceptable.

### Sequencing Issues

#### Critical Path Items
1. **Butcher Shop wall framing** must precede handsink plumbing rough-in
2. **Staff room furring wall** must be framed before plumbing rough-in for sink
3. **T-bar ceiling installation** (Butcher/Seafood) must coordinate with lighting, HVAC, sprinkler rough-in
4. **Millwork shop drawings** must be approved before fabrication begins (Customer Service, Floral, Staff millwork)
5. **Data conduit for ATM** should be installed during electrical rough-in phase to avoid later core drilling

### Unclear or Ambiguous Items

1. **Office hallway width adjustment**: Exact dimension not specified in text portion of PCN. Dimension must be scaled from drawing A2.1.

2. **NHWH-1 specification**: Type and model of water heater not specified. Assume point-of-use electric, but confirm capacity and electrical requirements.

3. **VT to F1 fixture change**: VT likely vapor-tight (sealed), F1 likely standard fluorescent or LED. Confirm exact fixture types and compatibility with T-bar ceiling system.

4. **Meat prep surface-mounted piping**: Specific pipe sizes and routing not detailed in architectural portion. Refer to mechanical base drawings M1.1 and M1.3 for existing conditions.

5. **Learn Office locker**: "Owner supplied locker" - dimensions, type, and anchoring requirements not specified. Assumes floor-mounted, but verify if wall-mounted (requires blocking).

## 7. COST IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Credit Items (Cost Reduction)
1. Staff Room #117 door deletion
2. Meat Prep cooler furring wall and concealed piping
3. Butcher Shop/Seafood Prep: (10) VT light fixtures

### Added Items (Cost Increase)
1. Staff Room #117: Furring wall, sink, microwave, millwork, plumbing, electrical
2. Butcher Shop: Full-height wall, FRP, stainless cap, handsink relocation
3. Butcher Shop/Seafood Prep: T-bar ceiling, ACT tiles, (10) F1 fixtures
4. Millwork modifications: Customer Service and Floral barrier-free counters
5. ATM/Coinstar/Water Dispenser: Electrical circuits and data conduit
6. Meat Prep: Insulation for surface-mounted piping
7. Learn Office: Locker installation

### Potentially Neutral Items
- Office hallway width adjustment (dimensional change)
- Barrier-free millwork (if caught before fabrication)
- Drawing replacements (design cost, not construction)

### Recommendation for Contractor Pricing
PCN states: "Contractor to submit signed letter with price including cost breakdown and change (if any) to construction schedule."

Contractor should provide:
1. Line-item breakdown by scope item (a through h, plus mechanical and electrical)
2. Separate credit and add costs
3. Net change to contract
4. Impact to construction schedule (if any)
5. Coordination costs (pre-construction meetings, additional shop drawings)

---

## 8. CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE IMPACT

### Potential Delays or Acceleration

**Staff Room Conversion**: Minor impact if done during office build-out phase. May delay staff occupancy if on critical path.

**Butcher Shop Wall**: Potential delay if refrigerated case installation in progress. Wall must be complete before case can be installed or positioned.

**Ceiling Change**: Significant trade coordination required. If lighting, sprinkler, and HVAC rough-in already complete for panel system, rework could cause 1-2 week delay.

**Millwork Modifications**: If shop drawings not yet approved, minimal impact. If millwork already fabricated, could cause 2-4 week delay for re-fabrication.

**ATM Data Conduit**: Should be installed during electrical rough-in. If rough-in complete, may require core drilling and patching.

### Recommended Mitigation
- Immediate approval of revised drawings by AHJ
- Expedited millwork shop drawing review
- Pre-construction coordination meeting with affected trades
- Parallel processing of mechanical and electrical permit revisions

## 9. QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKPOINTS

### Shop Drawing Submittals Required
1. Customer Service millwork (A8.2) - Review by Sobeys Design and Architect
2. Floral millwork (A8.3) - Review by Sobeys Design and Architect
3. Staff millwork (A8.4) - Review by Sobeys Design and Architect
4. Butcher Shop FRP installation - Verify substrate and adhesive compatibility
5. Stainless steel cap fabrication - Verify dimensions and finish

### Field Verification Points
1. Office hallway width - Verify egress compliance after framing
2. Barrier-free counter knee space - Verify no obstructions before millwork installation
3. Staff room plumbing - Verify routing before furring wall closure
4. Butcher Shop handsink - Verify location accessibility before rough-in
5. ATM data conduit - Pull test and label before closing walls
6. T-bar ceiling - Verify grid layout coordinates with lights, sprinklers, diffusers

### Testing Requirements
1. Plumbing rough-in inspection: Staff sink and relocated handsink
2. Plumbing final inspection: Fixture operation and drainage
3. Electrical rough-in inspection: New circuits and data conduit
4. Electrical final inspection: Receptacle testing, GFCI if required
5. Barrier-free access inspection: Counter heights and knee space clearances
6. Fire alarm testing: Security gate tie-in and magnetic lock release

## CONCLUSION

PCN# 013 represents a moderate-complexity set of building permit modifications affecting multiple trades. The primary changes involve:

1. **Space conversions** (storage to staff room)
2. **Accessibility upgrades** (barrier-free millwork)
3. **Construction methodology changes** (ceiling systems, concealed to surface piping)
4. **Equipment additions and relocations** (ATM, sinks, fixtures)

**Critical success factors**:
- Multi-trade coordination (especially Butcher Shop wall and ceiling changes)
- Timely approval of millwork shop drawings
- Verification of accessibility compliance
- Health authority acceptance of ceiling system in food prep areas

**Overall impact**: Moderate cost increase likely, with potential for minor schedule impact if coordination is well-managed. Contractor pricing submission will determine final cost and schedule implications.
