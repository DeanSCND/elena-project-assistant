## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Potential Issues Identified:

#### 1. **Voltage Discrepancy** (CRITICAL):
- **Equipment Nameplate**: 230V/1PH/60Hz (per Arneg cut sheet)
- **Panel Schedule**: 208V-1PH (per drawing E0.2)
- **Analysis**: 230V equipment on 208V system represents 9.6% voltage drop from nominal. While many 230V appliances can operate on 208V systems, this should be verified with manufacturer. R290 (propane) refrigerant systems may be more sensitive to voltage variations affecting compressor performance.
- **Recommendation**: Confirm with Arneg Canada that GENIUS 2 H145 units are rated for 208V operation or specify 208V-rated units.

#### 2. **MCA vs. MOP Compliance**:
- **04M Model Specifications**: MCA 14.31A, MOP 15A
- **Circuit Protection**: 15A-2P breaker on #12 wire
- **Analysis**: Installation meets minimum requirements but operates at the absolute limit. With MCA of 14.31A on a 15A circuit, there is only 0.69A (4.8%) margin. NEC requires conductor ampacity to be at least equal to the MCA.
- **#12 Wire Capacity**: 20A in typical conditions, but derated for continuous load should be 80% = 16A effective capacity
- **Status**: Marginally acceptable if equipment is non-continuous load. Should verify if refrigeration equipment is considered continuous (3+ hours).

#### 3. **Circuit Designation Clarification**:
- **PCN States**: "Circuits 22 and 24 are changed to 22,24 and 42,44 respectively"
- **Interpretation**:
  - First cooler: Circuits 22 & 24 (2-pole breaker spanning both)
  - Second cooler: Circuits 42 & 44 (2-pole breaker spanning both)
- **Verification Needed**: Confirm circuit numbers are correct and that circuits 42, 44 are available in Panel 'H' (schedule shows up to circuit 42 in some sections but appears to have space)

#### 4. **Propane Refrigerant Code Compliance**:
- **R290 Characteristics**: Propane is classified as A3 refrigerant (low toxicity, high flammability)
- **Code Requirements**: May require special installation considerations per ASHRAE 15 and local codes
- **Concerns**:
  - Maximum refrigerant charge limits in occupied spaces
  - Ventilation requirements
  - Proximity to ignition sources
  - Floor-level refrigerant detection (propane is heavier than air)
- **Status**: No specific safety notes included in PCN. Should verify compliance with local fire marshal and building code requirements for A3 refrigerant in retail food service area.

#### 5. **Wire Size Reduction**:
- **Original**: #10 wire for 15A-1P circuits
- **New**: #12 wire for 15A-2P circuits
- **Analysis**: While #12 is adequate for 15A breaker, the reduction from oversized #10 wire removes safety margin. This is acceptable per code but represents optimization for cost rather than safety margin.

#### 6. **Coordination Items**:
- **Millwork**: Electrical connection is at bottom of unit, 12" inset from front. Millwork must provide access panel or opening for plug connection.
- **Floor Loading**: Each unit weighs approximately 400-500 lbs when loaded. Verify floor loading capacity in HMR area, particularly if this is second floor or raised platform.
- **Clearances**: Unit depth of 28 3/8" must be coordinated with aisle widths and ADA clearances in customer circulation areas.
- **Drainage**: No floor drains mentioned for defrost water. Verify if units have internal evaporation or if floor drains are required.

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Electrical Code Compliance:

#### Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) Considerations:

**Rule 26-700 - Refrigeration Equipment**:
- Equipment must be listed and labeled for intended use
- ETL verification shown on cut sheet satisfies this requirement

**Rule 8-104 - Conductor Ampacity**:
- #12 copper conductor: 20A at 60°C, 25A at 90°C (Table 2)
- With 80% continuous load factor: 16A effective capacity
- MCA of 14.31A is within limits for #12 wire ✓

**Rule 14-104 - Overcurrent Protection**:
- 15A overcurrent protection appropriate for #12 wire ✓
- Overcurrent protection must not exceed MOP (15A specified) ✓

**Rule 26-744 - Disconnecting Means**:
- Twist-lock receptacle provides disconnecting means
- Must be accessible and within sight of equipment
- Drawing notes should specify "accessible receptacle location" - not explicitly stated

**Rule 62-114 - Commercial Cooking Equipment Receptacles**:
- HMR area contains gas cooking equipment (fryers, ovens, etc.)
- Receptacles in food prep areas should be waterproof (noted in Drawing E2.4, Note 4) ✓

#### Refrigerant-Specific Code Requirements:

**ASHRAE 15 - Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems**:

**Section 7.2 - Refrigerant Classification A3 (R290/Propane)**:
- Flammable refrigerant requires special considerations
- Maximum charge limits apply based on occupancy classification
- Retail food sales (Group M occupancy) has specific charge limits

**Section 7.4 - Machinery Room Requirements**:
- For charges exceeding limits, equipment may need to be in machinery room
- Open display cases in public areas typically limited to smaller charges
- Arneg units appear designed to meet "small charge" exemptions

**Section 8.12 - Refrigerant Detection**:
- Flammable refrigerants may require detection systems
- Local AHJ may mandate detection even for small charges
- **CRITICAL**: PCN does not address refrigerant detection requirements

**National Fire Code of Canada**:
- Flammable refrigerants classified as hazardous materials
- Storage and use restrictions may apply
- Fire marshal approval may be required for installation

#### Energy Code Compliance:

**DOE 2017 Certification** (shown on cut sheet):
- Equipment meets US Department of Energy efficiency standards
- "Energy Performance Verified" by Government of Canada indicates third-party testing
- Likely complies with NECB (National Energy Code for Buildings) requirements

#### Building Code Considerations:

**Accessibility**:
- Display cases in customer service area
- Reach ranges must comply with barrier-free design
- Top shelf at approximately 57" may exceed accessible reach range (48" max per NBC)
- Lower shelves appear within accessible reach

**Fire Safety**:
- A3 refrigerant classification requires fire safety review
- Proximity to cooking equipment (gas fryers, ovens) is concern
- May require enhanced fire suppression or separation

**Ventilation**:
- Propane is heavier than air (specific gravity 1.52)
- In event of refrigerant leak, propane will settle at floor level
- Floor-level ventilation and/or detection should be considered
- Not addressed in PCN documentation

### Missing Code Compliance Documentation:

1. **Fire Marshal Approval**: No indication that fire marshal has reviewed/approved A3 refrigerant use in retail space
2. **Refrigerant Charge Calculation**: Total R290 charge not specified; needed to verify compliance with ASHRAE 15 limits
3. **Detection System**: No refrigerant detection system specified despite flammable refrigerant
4. **Emergency Procedures**: No documentation of emergency response for refrigerant leak
5. **Maintenance Access**: No clarification on how technicians will safely service units in public area
6. **Separation from Ignition Sources**: Gas cooking equipment nearby; separation distances not verified

### Recommended Code Compliance Actions:

1. **Submit to Fire Marshal**: Provide complete refrigerant specifications and obtain approval for A3 refrigerant in Group M occupancy
2. **ASHRAE 15 Compliance Review**: Calculate total refrigerant charge and verify compliance with maximum limits for occupancy type
3. **Detection System Evaluation**: Determine if local jurisdiction requires refrigerant detection for propane-based equipment
4. **Voltage Verification**: Obtain written confirmation from manufacturer that 208V operation is approved (nameplate shows 230V)
5. **Accessibility Review**: Verify top shelf height complies with barrier-free design requirements if customer self-service
6. **Emergency Plan**: Develop emergency response procedures for refrigerant leak scenarios
7. **Maintenance Protocol**: Establish safe maintenance procedures for working on flammable refrigerant equipment in occupied space
