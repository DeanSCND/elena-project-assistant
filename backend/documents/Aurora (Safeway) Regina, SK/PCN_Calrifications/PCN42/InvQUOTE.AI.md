## 5. Identified Conflicts & Potential Issues

### Dimensional Considerations
- **Unusual dimension**: 11 15/16" (11.9375") is a precise non-standard measurement
  - Suggests custom millwork integration with tight tolerances
  - Potential for field verification required before fabrication
  - No dimensional tolerance specified in quote

### Procurement Issues
- **No lead time specified**: Quote doesn't indicate manufacturing/delivery timeline
- **C.O.D. terms**: Cash on delivery may affect project cash flow/payment scheduling
- **No installation included**: Quote is material-only; installation coordination required
- **18 pieces**: High quantity suggests potential for breakage allowance consideration

### Missing Information
- No edge treatment specified (polished, seamed, etc.)
- No safety glazing certification referenced (ANSI Z97.1 or CPSC 16 CFR 1201)
- No installation hardware included in quote
- No breakage/damage allowance mentioned
- No storage or handling requirements specified

---

## 6. Code Compliance Notes

### Safety Glass Requirements
- **Tempered glass specified**: Meets safety glazing requirements when properly certified
- **Typical Applications**:
  - Shelving
  - Display cases
  - Areas within 18" of walking surfaces
  - Locations subject to human impact per IBC 2406

### Required Certifications (Not Shown in Quote)
- ANSI Z97.1 (American National Standard for Safety Glazing Materials)
- CPSC 16 CFR 1201 (Consumer Product Safety Commission safety standard)
- Permanent manufacturer's label required on tempered glass
- **ACTION ITEM**: Verify certification will be provided with delivered product

### Building Code Considerations
- **IBC Section 2406**: Safety glazing requirements
- **Thickness**: 1/4" (6mm) suitable for light-duty applications
  - Typical for shelving with spans under 36"
  - May require verification for load-bearing applications
- **Commercial application**: Must meet commercial building standards for public access areas

### Installation Requirements (Not in Quote)
- Proper edge clearance required (typically 1/8" minimum)
- Setting blocks required for support
- Appropriate glazing method for application
- Professional installation recommended for safety glazing

---

## 7. Technical Analysis

### Glass Panel Characteristics
- **Tempered glass properties**:
  - 4-5 times stronger than annealed glass
  - Breaks into small, relatively harmless pieces
  - Cannot be cut or modified after tempering
  - All fabrication (holes, notches, edge work) must be done before tempering

### Application Inference
Based on dimensions (24" x 11 15/16" x 1/4"):
- Likely for shelving systems or display case components
- Size suggests modular/repetitive design
- Narrow height (12") indicates horizontal shelving rather than vertical glazing
- 18 pieces could indicate:
  - 6-bay shelving system with 3 shelves each
  - 9-bay system with 2 shelves each
  - Allowance for some breakage/spares

### Load Capacity Considerations
- 1/4" thickness suitable for light-duty shelving
- Recommended span limit: 24-36" with center support
- Typical load capacity: 20-30 lbs per shelf (requires structural verification)
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Verify with millwork shop drawings for intended load requirements

---

## 8. Cost Analysis

### Budget Implications
- **Per-piece cost**: $49.91 per panel ($898.44 ÷ 18)
- **Total with tax**: $943.36
- **GST applicable**: 5% rate applied (G code)
- **No PST**: May indicate interprovincial supply or exempt use

### Payment Terms
- **C.O.D.**: Cash on Delivery requires payment coordination
- **No retention**: Full payment required at delivery
- **Consider**: May need to be included in millwork contractor's payment requisition

3. **Confirm lead time**: Contact supplier for fabrication and delivery timeline
4. **Payment coordination**: Arrange C.O.D. payment with project accounting

### Design Coordination
1. **Structural verification**: Confirm 1/4" thickness adequate for intended loads
2. **Edge treatment**: Specify polished edges if required for exposed applications
3. **Installation method**: Review setting method with millwork contractor
4. **Breakage allowance**: Consider ordering spare pieces for large installation

### Documentation Requirements

## Summary

This quote represents a straightforward material procurement for 18 tempered glass panels for millwork integration. The panels are custom-sized (24" x 11 15/16" x 1/4") and appear intended for shelving or display case applications. Key concerns include verifying safety glazing certification, confirming dimensional accuracy with shop drawings, and coordinating C.O.D. payment. The 1/4" thickness is suitable for light-duty applications but should be verified against load requirements. Overall, this is a standard procurement item with appropriate safety glass specification, pending verification of certifications and dimensional coordination with millwork contractor.
