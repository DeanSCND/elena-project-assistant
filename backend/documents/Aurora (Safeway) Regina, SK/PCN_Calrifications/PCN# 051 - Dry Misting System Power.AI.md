## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Conflicts:

1. **Placement Coordination Required**:
   - PCN explicitly states "Placement to be coordinated on site"
   - No specific location shown on floor plan
   - Risk: Conflicts with other building systems (HVAC, refrigeration, sprinklers)
   - **Action Required**: Site coordination meeting before rough-in

2. **Manufacturer's Literature Dependency**:
   - Connection type not specified
   - Exact requirements not detailed
   - Wire sizing not indicated on schedules
   - **Action Required**: Obtain and review manufacturer's specifications before procurement

3. **Panel Capacity**:
   - Circuits 39 & 40 were previously marked as "SPACE"
   - Panel '2A' appears to have adequate spare capacity
   - Total load calculation not provided in PCN
   - **Verification Needed**: Confirm panel load does not exceed rating

4. **Produce Department Coordination**:
   - Misting systems typically serve produce areas
   - Drawing E2.3 references "Enlarged Seafood, Meats and Produce Power Drawings"
   - Spatial relationship to Produce Prep (Room 170) and Produce Cooler (Room 171) not clear
   - **Action Required**: Coordinate with produce department layout and refrigeration contractor

5. **Category 1 Location Compliance**:
   - General Note 11 states: "All receptacles and wiring methods within coolers, freezers, seafood prep, meat prep and produce prep areas shall be in accordance with CEC Rules 22-108 and 22-200 (Category 1 Location)"
   - If misting system is in produce prep area, special wiring requirements apply
   - **Verification Needed**: Confirm location and applicable code requirements

### Coordination Requirements:

1. **Refrigeration Contractor**: Micro Thermo (per note 30)
2. **Equipment Supplier**: Obtain misting system specifications
3. **General Contractor**: Space allocation and mounting surface
4. **Mechanical Contractor**: Coordinate with HVAC and drainage systems
5. **Owner's Representative**: Verify exact location prior to rough-in (General Note 15)

---

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) References:

1. **Circuit Protection**:
   - 15A breakers conform to standard branch circuit ratings
   - Two separate circuits suggest redundancy or zoned operation
   - Complies with CEC overcurrent protection requirements

2. **Voltage Classification**:
   - 120/208V system is standard commercial voltage
   - Low voltage (under 750V) classification
   - No special voltage considerations

3. **Category 1 Location (CEC 22-002)**:
   - **Applicable if system is in produce prep area**
   - CEC Rule 22-108: Wiring methods for damp/wet locations
   - CEC Rule 22-200: Additional requirements for commercial kitchens and food prep
   - Drawing Note 18 specifically addresses Category 1 requirements
   - Drawing Note 28 states: "Area to be considered a Category 1 location"

4. **Panel Schedule Requirements**:
   - Panel schedules properly document circuit additions
   - Circuit descriptions identify equipment served
   - Breaker ratings clearly indicated
   - Complies with CEC documentation requirements

5. **Installation Requirements**:
   - General Note 7: "Seal conduits where passing through floor, exterior walls, ceiling, coolers, freezers and meat room"
   - General Note 14: "All wiring for outlets and devices located on perimeter building walls shall be run concealed where visible to the public"
   - General Note 15: "Verify exact location of all stub-up locations with owner's representative, refrigeration contractor and fixture/equipment supplier prior to rough-in"

### Building Code Considerations:

1. **Fire Safety**:
   - No fire suppression interaction noted (unlike cooking equipment)
   - Standard circuit protection adequate

2. **Water/Moisture**:
   - Misting system introduces moisture
   - Category 1 wiring methods required if in food prep areas
   - Moisture-rated electrical components necessary

3. **HVAC Coordination**:
   - Misting system affects humidity levels
   - May interact with HVAC system operation
   - Coordinate with mechanical systems

### Permit & Inspection Requirements:

1. **Electrical Permit**: Required for new circuit installation
2. **Inspection Points**:
   - Rough-in inspection before concealment
   - Final inspection after equipment connection
   - Verify manufacturer's installation requirements followed

---

## 6. TECHNICAL NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### System Purpose:
Dry misting systems in grocery stores typically serve produce departments to:
- Maintain product freshness
- Control humidity levels
- Enhance visual appeal of produce displays
- Reduce product shrinkage

### Electrical Load Considerations:
- Total connected load: 30A (15A × 2 circuits)
- Likely demand: Lower than connected load due to cycling operation
- Two circuits suggest either:
  - Redundancy for critical operation
  - Separate zones/sections
  - Phase balancing requirements

### Installation Considerations:
1. **Water Supply**: Misting system requires plumbing coordination
2. **Drainage**: Excess water/condensate management needed
3. **Controls**: Control system integration not detailed in this PCN
4. **Mounting**: Overhead mounting typical for misting nozzles
5. **Maintenance Access**: Consider service access for filters/nozzles

### Documentation Gaps:
- No specific location plan view or section detail
- Wire sizing not specified
- Conduit size/routing not shown
- Control system wiring not addressed
- Emergency shutoff requirements not mentioned
- Integration with building automation system not detailed

## 7. RECOMMENDATIONS & ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate Actions:
1. Obtain manufacturer's installation manual and electrical specifications
2. Schedule site coordination meeting with all trades
3. Determine exact mounting location in produce department
4. Verify Panel '2A' load capacity with load calculations
5. Confirm Category 1 location requirements apply

### Design Clarifications Needed:
1. Exact location on floor plan
2. Wire size and conduit size requirements
3. Control system wiring and integration
4. Emergency shutoff requirements
5. Water supply and drainage coordination

### Construction Coordination:
1. Verify overhead clearances and obstructions
2. Coordinate with refrigeration case layout
3. Confirm mounting surface structural capacity
4. Schedule rough-in to avoid conflicts with other trades
5. Obtain owner's approval of final location before installation

### Testing & Commissioning:
1. Electrical circuit testing and verification
2. System operational testing with water supply
3. Integration with building controls (if applicable)
4. Documentation of as-built conditions
5. Training for maintenance staff
