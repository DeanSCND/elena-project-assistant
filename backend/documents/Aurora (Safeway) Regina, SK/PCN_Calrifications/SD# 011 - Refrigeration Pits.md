Additional Comments 
 

1) Refrigeration pits do not have liner securing rods that can be cast in concrete, and an aluminum frame that 

can be adjustable upward as per details drawings A7.0 and S1.3.  Manufacturer was specified in section 11 94 
00 in the project manual.  Consultants to confirm if this is accpetable.  
2) Manufacturer method for install: 

1. Install refrigeration pits on a granular base to set the height and location. 
2. Once the pit is set, screws can be screwed into the side of the pit before pouring concrete so that the 
pit won’t move in the concrete. 
3. Pour concrete around the pit. 
4. Remove the frame.
