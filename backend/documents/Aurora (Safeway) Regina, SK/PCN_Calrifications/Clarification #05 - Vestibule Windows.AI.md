## 4. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ITEMS

### Potential Issues

**1. Window Ordering/Fabrication**:
- **CRITICAL**: If W16 windows already ordered at 9'-6" width, this clarification may cause delays
- Verify window shop drawings status before implementation
- Confirm window manufacturer can accommodate revised dimension
- Check lead time impact if re-fabrication required

**2. Structural Coordination**:
- Rough opening reduction from 9'-6" to 8'-9" requires structural review
- Header/lintel sizing may change with narrower opening
- Verify framing members not already installed
- Check if wall framing is complete or in progress

**3. Adjacent Window Alignment**:
- Verify W16 reduction doesn't affect visual alignment with W14 or W15
- Check exterior elevation aesthetics with asymmetrical window sizing
- Confirm architect's design intent for fenestration pattern

**4. Interior/Exterior Finishes**:
- Wall finish materials around W16 affected by size change
- Sill conditions, trim, and cladding coordination required
- Interior finishes in vestibule may need adjustment

**5. Reason for Change Not Documented**:
- Clarification doesn't state WHY the 9" reduction is needed
- Could indicate conflict with another building element
- May be related to modular window sizing or availability
- Could affect other undocumented items

**6. Angled Wall Complexity**:
- W16 is on an angled wall, making rough opening modifications more complex
- Framing adjustments on angled walls require careful layout
- Verify dimension is measured perpendicular to wall or along wall face

**7. No Height Dimension Provided**:
- Clarification only addresses width reduction
- Assumes height remains unchanged - should be verified
- Check if rough opening height is also affected

## 5. CODE COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Building Code Considerations

**1. Natural Light Requirements**:
- Window size reduction decreases glazed area by ~7.9%
- Verify vestibule still meets minimum daylight/view requirements
- Check Saskatchewan Building Code natural light provisions for retail spaces
- Confirm no minimum glazing percentage requirement is violated

**2. Egress and Life Safety**:
- Vestibule 100 serves as entry/exit route
- Verify window reduction doesn't impact egress width calculations
- Confirm visibility requirements for exit path maintained
- Check any fire rating requirements for vestibule construction

**3. Energy Code Compliance**:
- Reduced window area affects envelope U-value calculations
- May improve thermal performance (less glazing = less heat loss)
- Verify energy model doesn't require recalculation
- Confirm NECB (National Energy Code for Buildings) compliance maintained

**4. Accessibility**:
- Vestibule must remain accessible per barrier-free requirements
- Verify door clearances and maneuvering space not affected by wall changes
- Check vision panel requirements if W16 serves that function

**5. Structural Loading**:
- Modified header/lintel must meet structural load requirements
- Verify lateral wind loads on revised window size
- Confirm seismic detailing for glazing system

**6. Thermal Performance**:
- Saskatchewan climate requires high-performance glazing
- Verify W16 maintains required thermal resistance
- Check condensation resistance requirements

## 6. CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCING NOTES

### Implementation Considerations

**Timing**:
- Clarification dated April 21, 2025
- Issue as early notice to subcontractors
- Coordinate with window supplier immediately
- Verify construction schedule impact (document states "no change")

**Trade Coordination**:
1. General Contractor (Quorex) - overall coordination
2. Framing subcontractor - rough opening modification
3. Window supplier/installer - revised window fabrication
4. Exterior cladding contractor - finish coordination
5. Interior finishes - trim and drywall adjustments

**Verification Steps**:
- Field verify existing conditions before modification
- Confirm no conflicts with installed work
- Document as-built conditions
- Update shop drawings and submittals
- Photograph before/during/after conditions

   - Provide revised shop drawings
   - Update fabrication schedule if needed

3. **Structural Engineer**:
   - Review rough opening modification
   - Verify header/lintel adequacy
   - Issue revised structural details if required

4. **Architect**:
   - Update architectural drawings
   - Revise window schedule
   - Update exterior elevations
   - Issue addendum if specification changes required

5. **All Trades**:
   - Review for downstream impacts
   - Flag any cost or schedule concerns
   - Request clarification if dimension measurement unclear

## 9. SUMMARY

This clarification reduces window W16 rough opening width by 9 inches (from 9'-6" to 8'-9") in the vestibule entrance area. The modification affects an angled wall feature window and requires coordination across multiple trades. The document explicitly states there is no change to contract price or schedule, suggesting this is a minor field adjustment or design refinement. However, verification with the window supplier and structural engineer is critical to ensure the change can be accommodated without impact. The 9-inch reduction may be driven by modular window sizing, coordination conflicts, or aesthetic considerations not detailed in the clarification.

**Risk Level**: LOW to MEDIUM (depending on window fabrication status)
**Cost Impact**: Stated as NONE (but verify with window supplier)
**Schedule Impact**: Stated as NONE (but verify fabrication lead time)
**Coordination Priority**: HIGH (window supplier and structural engineer)
