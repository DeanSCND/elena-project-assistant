# PCN# 033 - Ice Melt Tub - Technical Data

**Document Type**: Proposed Change Notice (PCN)
**PCN Number**: 2445-33
**Date**: August 20, 2025
**Project**: Aurora Food Store, 2000 Anaquod Road, Regina, SK
**Commission**: 2445
**Contractor**: Quorex Construction Services Ltd.
**Architect**: Kevin Fawley, SAA MRAIC

## Executive Summary

This PCN eliminates the previously specified ice melt tub installation from the project scope. The stainless steel ice melt station/tub was to be owner-supplied and installed by the contractor, but is now being deleted entirely. The concrete tub area will instead be finished with epoxy flooring to match adjacent surfaces.

---

## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Scope Deletions Required
1. **Physical Equipment**: Ice melt tub hardware
2. **Drawing Detail**: Detail #7-15/A10.2
3. **Schedule Entry**: "Ice Melt Tub" from equipment list

### Potential Coordination Issues

**Mechanical/Plumbing**:
- **Drain Connection**: Ice melt tub would have required floor drain or dedicated drainage
  - Status of drain rough-in unclear (may be already installed)
  - Drain may need to remain for floor washing
  - Verify if drain can be eliminated or must remain

**Structural**:
- **Concrete Tub**: PCN references "tub concrete surfaces"
  - Indicates concrete tub may already be formed/poured
  - Tub depression in slab requires infill or finishing
  - Verify if tub was meant as depression or raised curb

**Finishes**:
- **Floor Transition**: Epoxy FF3 to match adjacent flooring
  - Requires coordination with flooring contractor
  - Color/texture matching to adjacent seafood department floor
  - If tub is depression, may create trip hazard or require infill

**Equipment**:
- **Ice Flaker**: Still in scope (shown in schedule)
  - Ice melt tub typically receives melt water from ice machine
  - Without tub, ice machine condensate/melt requires alternative drainage
  - Verify ice machine drain routing

### Missing Information
- **Concrete Tub Status**: Is it already constructed? If so, infill or finish in place?
- **Plumbing Rough-in**: Were drains already installed?
- **Ice Machine Drainage**: Alternative method for ice melt water disposal
- **Cost Impact**: PCN requires contractor pricing submission

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Accessibility
- **Floor Surface**: Epoxy floor must be slip-resistant (commercial kitchen requirement)
- **Level Changes**: If tub creates floor depression, may require:
  - Infill to maintain level floor
  - Or compliant slope transitions
  - Visual contrast if level change >1/4"

### Plumbing Code
- **Drainage**: Ice machines typically require:
  - Indirect waste connection
  - Air gap for sanitation
  - If ice melt tub provided this, alternative drainage method needed
  - Floor sink or alternative receptor may be required

### Food Safety
- **Sanitation**: Ice handling area requires:
  - Easily cleanable surfaces
  - Proper drainage
  - No standing water
  - Epoxy floor finish addresses cleanability

### Building Code
- **Floor Finishes**: Commercial food preparation areas
  - Non-absorbent surfaces required
  - Epoxy FF3 likely complies
  - Must be seamless and cove base at walls

---

## 6. Cost & Schedule Impact

### Contractor Requirements (per PCN header)
- Submit signed letter with pricing
- Include cost breakdown
- Note any change to construction schedule
- Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) to advise of objections

### Potential Cost Impacts

**Credits (deletions)**:
- Ice melt tub installation labor
- Plumbing connections (if applicable)
- Detail coordination time

**Additions**:
- Epoxy flooring FF3 for tub area
- Potential concrete infill (if tub is depression)
- Coordination for drain capping/rerouting

**Net Impact**: Likely credit to owner, but depends on:
- Whether concrete tub already constructed
- Extent of plumbing rough-in completed
- Rework required

## 8. Action Items & Follow-Up

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Contractor**: Submit pricing and schedule impact analysis
2. **Architect**: Confirm deletion of Detail #7-15/A10.2 from drawing set
3. **Mechanical Engineer**: Verify ice machine drainage alternative
4. **GC**: Assess status of concrete tub construction
5. **GC**: Determine plumbing rough-in status

### Verification Needed
- Current status of concrete work (tub poured or not?)
- Ice machine model and drainage requirements
- Floor drain requirements for seafood department
- Epoxy flooring color/specification FF3 details
- Coordination with adjacent flooring contractor

### Drawing Updates Required
- Delete Detail #7-15/A10.2
- Update floor plan showing epoxy finish in tub area
- Update plumbing plans if drain connections change
- Update finish schedule to show epoxy FF3 in tub location
- Update equipment schedule (already shown with strikethrough)

---

## 9. Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Epoxy flooring application (standard finish)
- Deletion from equipment schedule

### Medium Risk
- Coordination of ice machine drainage without tub
- Floor finish transitions and matching
- Schedule impact if concrete tub requires demolition/infill

### High Risk
- **If concrete tub already constructed**: Significant rework cost
- **If plumbing rough-in complete**: Wasted material and labor costs
- **Code compliance**: Alternative ice melt drainage must meet health codes

---

## 10. Technical Notes

### Epoxy Flooring FF3
- "FF3" designation requires verification against project finish schedule
- Must match adjacent flooring in:
  - Color
  - Texture/aggregate
  - Gloss level
  - Thickness
- Requires proper surface preparation of concrete
- Curing time may impact schedule

### Ice Handling Without Melt Tub
- Standard alternatives include:
  - Floor sink with grate
  - Indirect waste receptor
  - Automatic ice dispensers with integral drainage
- Must maintain sanitary conditions
- Consider seafood department workflow

## Summary

PCN #033 removes a stainless steel ice melt tub from the Seafood Department scope. The deletion affects architectural details, equipment schedules, and likely mechanical/plumbing systems. The most critical coordination issue is determining the status of the concrete tub construction and ensuring proper drainage for the ice machine that would have used this tub. All affected tub surfaces will receive epoxy FF3 flooring to match adjacent areas. The contractor must submit pricing before any work proceeds, and the change requires formal Change Order authorization.
