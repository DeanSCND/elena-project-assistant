## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Specification Inconsistency (Resolved)
**Issue**: Original specification Section 3.2.8 required shop-field paint finish or priming for OWSJ, which was inconsistent with project intent.

**Resolution**:
- Delete Section 3.2.8 entirely
- Confirm that CISC/CPMA 2-75 primer is NOT required

### Potential Coordination Concerns

1. **Corrosion Protection Review**
   - OWSJ will now be uncoated/unprimed
   - Verify interior environment is suitable for uncoated steel
   - Confirm OWSJ location is not in areas with moisture exposure
   - Consider if food storage areas require additional protection

2. **Fire Protection Coordination**
   - Ensure uncoated OWSJ finish is compatible with fire protection systems
   - Verify spray-applied fireproofing (if required) can properly adhere to uncoated steel
   - Coordinate with Section 07 84 00 Firestopping (if applicable)

3. **Aesthetic Considerations**
   - Confirm exposed OWSJ (if any) are acceptable in uncoated condition
   - Verify ceiling finishes will conceal OWSJ members
   - Coordinate with architectural reflected ceiling plans

4. **Shop Drawing Impact**
   - Steel fabricator shop drawings may need revision if previously showing primed finish
   - Verify submittals reflect "no coating" requirement
   - Potential cost savings should be tracked (even if not changing contract price per clarification)

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Standards & Codes Referenced

**CISC/CPMA 2-75**:
- Canadian Institute of Steel Construction / Canadian Paint Manufacturers Association
- Standard for structural steel coating systems
- Note: This standard has been superseded by more recent editions
- CISC/CPMA 2-75 is an older reference; verify current standards in force

**CAN/CGSB**:
- Canadian General Standards Board
- Referenced for Commercial Blast Cleaning requirements (now deleted)

### Compliance Considerations

1. **Building Code Compliance**
   - Verify uncoated OWSJ meets National Building Code of Canada (NBC) requirements
   - Ensure corrosion protection (or lack thereof) is appropriate for building classification
   - Confirm compliance with Saskatchewan Building Code

2. **Fire Rating**
   - Coating removal does not affect structural fire rating requirements
   - OWSJ must still meet fire resistance ratings per building code
   - Applied fireproofing (if required) is separate from primer coating

3. **Material Standards**
   - OWSJ to comply with CSA S16 (Design of Steel Structures)
   - Steel Institute of Canada (CISC) standards for fabrication and erection
   - Material specifications per ASTM A36 or A572 (typical for OWSJ)

4. **Environmental Conditions**
   - Interior environment classification per NBC Part 5
   - Verify OWSJ location is classified as "dry" environment
   - Food store environments typically require review for humidity/temperature variations

### Quality Assurance

- **Shop Inspection**: Verify OWSJ delivered without primer coating
- **Field Verification**: Confirm no field painting required upon erection
- **Submittals**: Update product data to reflect uncoated finish
- **Closeout**: Update as-built drawings to reflect actual OWSJ finish condition

## 6. Action Items & Recommendations

### For General Contractor (Quorex Construction Services Ltd.)
1. Update project specifications manual to delete Section 05 20 00, Item 3.2.8
2. Notify steel fabricator of coating requirement deletion
3. Verify shop drawings reflect uncoated OWSJ
4. Confirm no pricing adjustments despite potential material savings
5. Update project schedule if coating deletion affects fabrication timeline (though clarification states no schedule impact)

### For Design Team (Nejmark Architect / CGM Engineering)
1. Review other sections for similar coating references that may need updating
2. Verify structural drawings do not specify OWSJ primer in notes or details
3. Confirm mechanical/electrical coordination for OWSJ penetrations (uncoated condition)
4. Consider issuing specification update package to replace deleted section

### For Owner (Sobeys Inc.)
1. Accept clarification terms (no cost/schedule impact)
2. Verify operational requirements support uncoated OWSJ in food store environment
3. Confirm maintenance manual reflects actual OWSJ condition

## Appendix: Technical Background

### Open Web Steel Joists (OWSJ)
- Prefabricated steel trusses with parallel top and bottom chords connected by web members
- Typically used for roof and floor framing in commercial construction
- Manufactured per Steel Joist Institute (SJI) standards
- Common in retail/food store applications for economical long-span framing

### CISC/CPMA 2-75 Standard
- Established coating system requirements for structural steel
- Specified primer types, application methods, and dry film thickness
- Has been updated/superseded by newer standards (SSPC, CISC Guide, etc.)
- Reference in specification suggests older master specification document

### Typical Reasons for Coating Deletion
1. Interior dry environment - no corrosion risk
2. OWSJ fully concealed by ceiling system
3. Cost/schedule optimization
4. Compatibility with applied fireproofing materials
5. Shop-applied coatings may interfere with welded connections
