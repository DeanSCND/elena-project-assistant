## 4. Identified Conflicts & Coordination Issues

### Critical Coordination Items

1. **Developer Interface**
   - **Issue**: Loading ramp must match developer's grading/asphalt at elevation 581.690
   - **Risk**: If developer's work deviates from 581.690, ramp will not align properly
   - **Recommendation**: Verify developer's as-built grading before finalizing ramp construction
   - **Status**: Clarification issued; requires field verification

2. **Slope Modification**
   - **Original Design**: 3.5% slope
   - **Modified Design**: 4.2% slope (20% increase in grade)
   - **Impact**: Steeper ramp may affect:
     - Accessibility compliance (see Code Compliance section below)
     - Delivery truck maneuverability
     - Snow/ice management
     - Drainage patterns
   - **Question**: Was this slope increase necessary due to elevation mismatch?

3. **Elevation Notation Discrepancy**
   - **Top of Ramp**: 581.690 (orange annotation at top right)
   - **Bottom Notation**: 591.690 (orange annotation at bottom right)
   - **Concern**: 10-foot elevation difference seems excessive for a loading ramp
   - **Likely Issue**: Typo in drawing annotation - both should probably be 581.690
   - **Recommendation**: Verify actual elevation difference and correct annotation

4. **Multi-Slope Configuration**
   - Drawing shows multiple slope percentages (1%, 3.5%, 4.2%, 4.7%)
   - **Question**: Is this a compound slope or showing before/after conditions?
   - **Clarity Needed**: Which slopes apply to final construction?

### Potential Issues

1. **Drainage Coordination**
   - Slope changes affect drainage patterns
   - Need to verify site drainage plan accommodates modified slopes
   - Ensure positive drainage away from building

2. **ADA/Accessibility Compliance**
   - Slope increase may approach or exceed maximum accessible ramp slopes
   - See code compliance section below

3. **Construction Sequencing**
   - Ramp construction dependent on developer's grading completion
   - Timing coordination critical to avoid rework

---

## 5. Code Compliance Notes

### Accessibility - Loading Dock Ramps

**National Building Code of Canada (NBC)**:
- **Accessible Ramps**: Maximum slope 1:12 (8.33%) for accessible routes
- **Loading Dock Ramps**: Not typically required to be accessible routes
- **Service Areas**: May have steeper slopes if not part of barrier-free path

**Analysis of Clarification #03**:
- **Modified Slope**: 4.2% (1:23.8 ratio) - COMPLIANT for accessible ramps
- **Upper Segment**: 4.7% (1:21.3 ratio) - COMPLIANT for accessible ramps
- **Interior Platform**: 1% slope - COMPLIANT (typical for drainage)

**Verdict**: All slopes shown are well below maximum accessible slope of 8.33%, therefore compliant if this is an accessible route. However, loading dock ramps typically are not required to be accessible.

### Safety Considerations

1. **Maximum Ramp Slopes** (NBC Part 3.3.1):
   - **Pedestrian Ramps**: Maximum 1:8 (12.5%) for non-accessible service ramps
   - **Vehicular Ramps**: Maximum 15% for trucks, 12% preferred
   - **Loading Ramps**: 4.2% is conservative and safe

2. **Slip Resistance**:
   - Outdoor ramps in Regina, SK (cold climate) require:
     - Non-slip surface finish
     - Adequate drainage to prevent ice buildup
     - Consider heated ramp or chemical treatment in winter

3. **Guardrails/Edge Protection**:
   - If ramp has drop-off greater than 600mm (24"), requires guardrail
   - Cannot determine from this clarification - check site sections

### Drainage Code Requirements

**NBC Part 5.7 (Exterior Drainage)**:
- Minimum 1% slope away from building (achieved in this design)
- Positive drainage required; ponding not permitted
- Modified slopes support adequate drainage

### Structural Load Considerations

**NBC Part 4 (Structural Design)**:
- Loading dock ramps subject to vehicle loads
- Typical design loads: 5 kPa live load minimum for vehicle access
- Slope change may affect structural loads/reactions
- **Note**: Clarification states no structural implications, but verify with structural engineer

## 6. Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Developer's Grading**
   - Confirm developer's asphalt will be at elevation 581.690
   - Obtain as-built survey before ramp construction
   - Coordinate timing with developer's sitework

2. **Clarify Elevation Notation**
   - Confirm whether 591.690 notation is typo
   - Request corrected drawing if discrepancy exists

3. **Review Accessibility Requirements**
   - Confirm whether loading dock ramp is part of accessible route
   - Document rationale for slope selection

### Design Verification

1. **Drainage Analysis**
   - Verify modified slopes integrate with site drainage plan
   - Check for potential ponding areas at ramp transitions

2. **Truck Turning Analysis**
   - Confirm 4.2% slope doesn't impact delivery truck operations
   - Verify clearances for typical delivery vehicles

3. **Winter Operations**
   - Assess ice/snow management strategy for steeper slope
   - Consider heated ramp or enhanced snow removal procedures

### Documentation

1. **As-Built Requirements**
   - Survey ramp elevation upon completion
   - Document actual slopes achieved
   - Photograph transition to developer's asphalt

2. **Coordination Records**
   - Document all coordination with developer
   - Maintain record of elevation verification
   - File clarification with project closeout documents

## 8. Summary & Action Items

### Key Findings
1. Loading ramp elevation must match developer's work at 581.690
2. Ramp slope modified from 3.5% to 4.2% (potentially 4.7% upper section)
3. Possible elevation notation error (591.690 vs 581.690)
4. Multiple referenced architectural sections require review
5. All slopes appear code-compliant

### Critical Path Items
- [ ] Verify developer's grading completion and elevation
- [ ] Confirm elevation notation (resolve 591.690 discrepancy)
- [ ] Survey existing conditions before ramp construction
- [ ] Review referenced sections A5.1 and A5.2 for full context
- [ ] Coordinate construction timing with developer's sitework

### Risk Factors
- **High**: Dependency on developer's work completion and accuracy
- **Medium**: Slope increase impact on winter operations
- **Low**: Code compliance (all slopes within acceptable limits)
