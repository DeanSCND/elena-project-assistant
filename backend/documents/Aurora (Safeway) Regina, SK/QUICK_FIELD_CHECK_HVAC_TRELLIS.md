# QUICK FIELD CHECK - HVAC vs TRELLIS CLEARANCE
**Aurora Food Store Regina - GET THIS DONE IN 30 MINUTES**

---

## YOU'RE PROBABLY FINE - HERE'S HOW TO CONFIRM

**Bottom line:** Estimated 13"-26" clearance. If you can get 6" minimum, you're good to go.

---

## FIELD MEASUREMENTS NEEDED (4 QUICK CHECKS)

### 1. FIND FINISHED FLOOR TO DECK HEIGHT
**Who does it:** Anyone with a laser measure or tape

**How:**
- Stand in sales floor (middle of store, away from walls)
- Shoot laser straight up to underside of metal deck
- Write down number: **_______ feet**

**Expected:** Should be ~21'-6" to 22'-0"

---

### 2. MEASURE DUCT DROP FROM DECK
**Who does it:** Mechanical guy

**How:**
- Look at the **biggest** duct trunk (main supply from RTU)
- Measure from bottom of deck to bottom of duct
- Include the insulation wrap
- Write down: **_______ inches** (or ______ feet)

**Expected:** Probably 30"-48" (2.5' to 4')

---

### 3. CALCULATE BOTTOM OF DUCTWORK
**Math:**
- Take measurement #1 (deck height): _______ ft
- Subtract measurement #2 (duct drop): - _______ ft
- **= Bottom of duct from floor: _______ ft**

**Example:**
- Deck height: 22'-0"
- Duct drops: 3'-6"
- Bottom of duct = 18'-6" above floor

---

### 4. CHECK CLEARANCE TO TRELLIS
**Trellis info from drawings:**
- Bottom of trellis: **15'-4"** above floor
- Trellis is about **12"** deep
- **Top of trellis: ~16'-4"** above floor

**Your clearance:**
- Bottom of duct (from #3): _______
- Top of trellis: 16'-4"
- **CLEARANCE = _______ inches**

---

## DECISION TIME

### ✅ CLEARANCE > 12" - YOU'RE GOLDEN
- Install both as drawn
- No coordination needed
- Keep moving

### ⚠️ CLEARANCE 6" to 12" - YOU'RE FINE BUT WATCH IT
**Do this:**
1. Mechanical: Route ducts to AVOID directly over trellis if easy
2. Take photos of clearances for record
3. Install trellis first, then route ducts around it
4. Tell your super you checked it

### 🛑 CLEARANCE < 6" - YOU HAVE OPTIONS

**Quick fixes (pick one):**

**Option A - Move the trellis** (easiest)
- Drop trellis cables another 6"-12"
- New bottom height: 14'-6" to 15'-0"
- Still clears heads (6'-8" min is code, you're at 14'+)
- **DO THIS** - takes 10 minutes to adjust cables

**Option B - Reroute ducts** (if mechanical hasn't installed yet)
- Run main trunks down aisles (between trellis sections)
- Use smaller branch ducts over trellis areas
- Flat-oval duct if you need to sneak under something

**Option C - Cut trellis short** (last resort)
- Eliminate trellis sections in conflict zones
- Owner probably won't care about 10' less trellis
- Better than ripping out ductwork

## FASTEST PATH FORWARD

### IF NOTHING IS INSTALLED YET:
1. Mechanical installs main duct trunks FIRST
2. Measure actual bottom of duct heights
3. Adjust trellis cable lengths to fit under
4. Problem solved

### IF TRELLIS IS ALREADY UP:
1. Measure clearance to top of trellis
2. Route ducts around it
3. Use flexible transitions if needed
4. You'll figure it out

### IF DUCTS ARE ALREADY UP:
1. Measure bottom of ducts
2. Shorten trellis cables by 6"-12" if needed
3. Trellis at 14'-6" to 15'-0" still looks fine
4. Done

## REAL TALK

**You have ~18" to work with.** Commercial RTUs typically need 36"-42" duct drop. Deck is probably 21'-22' up. That puts duct bottoms around 18'-0" to 18'-6" above floor.

**Trellis tops out at 16'-4".**

**You've got 2+ feet of clearance.** You're fine.

**Only fuck yourself if:**
- You have a massive 48" x 48" duct trunk (you don't - your biggest RTU only needs ~20"x20")
- Deck is way lower than expected (go measure it)
- Someone already welded the trellis at the wrong height (adjust the cables)

---

## WHO DOES WHAT RIGHT NOW

**Mechanical foreman:**
- Shoot laser to deck: _____ ft
- Measure duct size: _____ x _____
- Measure duct drop: _____ inches
- Bottom of duct = _____ ft above floor
- Text this to super

**Decor/GC:**
- Trellis goes at 15'-4" bottom (unless mech guy says lower it)
- If you need to drop it to 14'-6", whatever, do it
- Don't wait for paperwork

**Superintendent:**
- Get both numbers
- If clearance > 6", green light both trades
- If not, have them talk for 5 minutes and fix it
- Move on

## THE ANSWER YOU WANTED

**Are they fucked?** No.

**Can they figure it out?** Yes - measure twice, adjust once.

**Keep moving?** Absolutely. This is a 30-minute coordination check, not a project-stopper.

**Stop reading. Go measure. Text the numbers. Install the shit. Done.**
