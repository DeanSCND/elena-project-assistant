# QUOREX CONSTRUCTION - SITE INSTRUCTION
**TO:** Site Superintendent - Aurora Safeway Regina
**FROM:** Chris Walbaum
**DATE:** January 9, 2026
**RE:** HVAC Ductwork & Trellis Coordination - DO THIS TODAY

---

## SITUATION

We need to confirm mechanical duct clearances won't hit the decorative trellis in the sales floor. Based on the drawings, we should have clearance, but nobody's verified it yet and both trades are ready to install.

**I don't want surprises. I don't want rework. I don't want change orders.**

---

## YOUR INSTRUCTIONS - GET THIS DONE THIS MORNING

### STEP 1: TAKE 3 MEASUREMENTS (15 minutes)

Get someone with a laser measure in the middle of the sales floor:

1. **Floor to underside of deck:** __________ ft (should be ~21'-6" to 22'-0")

2. **Ask mechanical foreman:** What's the deepest duct drop from deck to bottom of duct including insulation?
   Answer: __________ inches or __________ ft

3. **Do the math:**
   - Deck height: ______
   - Minus duct drop: ______
   - **= Bottom of duct above floor: ______**

### STEP 2: COMPARE TO TRELLIS (5 minutes)

From drawings:
- Trellis bottom: **15'-4"** above floor
- Trellis depth: **~12"**
- **Trellis top: ~16'-4"** above floor

**YOUR CLEARANCE:**
- Bottom of duct (from Step 1): ______
- Top of trellis: 16'-4"
- **CLEARANCE = ______ inches**

### STEP 3: MAKE THE CALL (10 minutes)

#### IF CLEARANCE IS 12"+
✅ **Green light both trades. Install as planned. Done.**

#### IF CLEARANCE IS 6" TO 12"
⚠️ **OK to proceed with these conditions:**
- Mechanical routes main trunks to AVOID running directly over trellis (use aisles/between sections)
- Install mechanical FIRST, then fit trellis around ducts
- Take photos of tight spots for record
- **Text me the clearance number and "proceeding with coordination"**

#### IF CLEARANCE IS LESS THAN 6"
🛑 **Pick fastest fix:**

**Option A:** Lower the trellis 6"-12" (adjust cable lengths)
- Trellis at 14'-6" to 15'-0" still looks fine and clears heads
- **This is probably your answer - takes 20 minutes**

**Option B:** Reroute ducts around trellis sections
- Only if mechanical hasn't started installation
- Have mech foreman sketch revised routing, text me photo

**Option C:** Call me before you do anything stupid

---

## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

**By noon today, text me:**

1. "Deck height: XX ft"
2. "Duct bottom: XX ft"
3. "Clearance: XX inches"
4. "Status: GREEN / COORDINATING / ISSUE"

**If status is anything except GREEN, call me immediately.**

---

## WHY WE'RE DOING THIS

- Sobeys is watching this job like a hawk
- We've already got 60+ PCNs on this project
- I'm not issuing PCN #64 because we didn't measure before installing
- This is basic coordination - we should've caught it in pre-con but we're catching it now
- Better 30 minutes today than 3 days of rework next month

---

## TRADE COORDINATION

**Tell both foremen:**

**Mechanical:** "Don't install main duct trunks over the sales floor until we verify clearances to the trellis. Check with super first. You can work on branch duct, equipment connections, anything else."

**Decor/Millwork:** "Trellis installation may need to shift by 6-12 inches depending on duct routing. Stand by for final mounting height confirmation. You can prep hardware, layout cable locations, anything else."

---

## BACKUP PLAN

**If for some reason you can't get this done today:**

1. Keep both trades off the trellis/duct area
2. Have them work on other areas (back of house, perimeter, offices, etc.)
3. Call me and explain why

But honestly, this should take you less than an hour start to finish.

---

## WHAT I'M SENDING YOU

1. **This memo** - your marching orders
2. **Quick reference sheet** with the measurements and math
3. **Full coordination doc** - for your files, you probably won't need it

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**My expectation:** By end of day, both mechanical and decor are installing with confirmed clearances. No delays. No conflicts. No drama.

**Your job:** Verify the numbers, coordinate the trades, make the call, keep us moving.

You've got everything you need. The drawings say we have clearance. Go prove it, document it, and get both crews working.

**Questions? Call me. Updates? Text me. Problems? Call me immediately.**
