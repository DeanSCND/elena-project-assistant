## 7. IDENTIFIED CONFLICTS & COORDINATION ISSUES

### Potential Coordination Issues Flagged:

**1. Sloped Floor Coordination (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Multiple coolers and prep areas have sloped floors
- Coordination required between:
  - Structural engineer (slab design and drainage slopes)
  - Cooler/freezer panel installer (panel base transitions)
  - Mechanical engineer (floor drain locations and elevations)
  - Architectural finishes (floor finish transitions)
- **Note**: "Sloped floors at cooler panels to be poured as topping and coordinated with cooler box installer"
- **Risk**: Improper coordination could result in drainage issues, panel installation problems, or rework

**2. Refrigeration Line Penetrations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Extensive refrigeration piping throughout building
- Penetrations through walls, roof, and ceiling required
- Coordination points:
  - GC to patch all holes required for refrigeration lines
  - Seal all penetrations through fire separations
  - Seal all pipes penetrating cooler/freezer box walls/ceilings
  - Exposed spray foam is not acceptable
- **Risk**: Fire rating compromises, thermal bridging, aesthetic issues if not properly detailed

**3. Structural Support for Free-Standing Walls (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Multiple pony walls and partial-height walls shown
- Notes indicate "Provide steel angles/HSS columns for all free-standing walls. Refer to Structural."
- Vertical HSS inside pony walls required
- **Coordination needed**:
  - Architectural layout and wall locations
  - Structural design and load calculations
  - P.Eng sealed shop drawings
- **Risk**: Inadequate structural support, code compliance issues

**4. Roof Drainage System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Roof slopes indicated at 1% slope in multiple directions
- Tapered insulation system required
- Coordination between:
  - Architectural roof plan
  - Structural roof framing
  - Mechanical roof drains and overflow scuppers
  - Roofing contractor (tapered insulation layout)
- **Risk**: Ponding water, membrane failure, drainage backup

**5. Ceiling Heights and Bulkheads (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Variable ceiling heights throughout
- Bulkhead locations for:
  - Ductwork
  - Refrigeration lines
  - Electrical/data runs
  - Aesthetic features
- Coordination required:
  - Architectural reflected ceiling plan
  - Mechanical duct routing
  - Electrical/lighting layout
  - Structural clearances
- **Risk**: Insufficient clearance, rework, aesthetic issues

**6. Fire-Rated Assemblies (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Fire-rated partitions to extend to underside of deck
- All interior partitions carrying to U/S of steel deck require slip joints
- Seal all penetrations through fire separations
- 1-hour rated wall (Type A4a) requires 5/8" Type X gypsum board both sides
- **Coordination needed**:
  - Architectural wall types
  - Structural deck details
  - Mechanical/electrical penetrations
  - Fire protection continuity
- **Risk**: Code non-compliance, failed fire inspection

**7. High Voltage Electrical (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Note indicates "12" x 12' concrete for high voltage electrical supply"
- Appears to be located in specific area (likely exterior or electrical room)
- Coordination between:
  - Electrical engineer (service size and location)
  - Structural engineer (foundation/pad design)
  - Utility company (service routing)
  - Architectural site plan
- **Risk**: Delayed utility connection, redesign costs

**8. Owner-Supplied Equipment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Multiple instances of "Sobeys supplied, GC installed" equipment
- Security gates tied to fire alarm system
- Display cases and refrigeration equipment
- GC responsible for:
  - Coordinating exact locations
  - Providing backing/blocking
  - Electrical connections
  - Plumbing connections
  - Verifying dimensions
- **Risk**: Equipment delivery delays, installation conflicts, dimensional mismatches

**9. Signage Coordination (LOW PRIORITY)**
- Exterior signage requires:
  - Plywood backing and blocking
  - Electrical power
  - Structural support
  - Permit applications
- Two pre-approved vendors specified
- Shop drawings required for review
- **Coordination needed**:
  - Architectural locations
  - Structural support design
  - Electrical power routing
  - Municipal permit process
- **Risk**: Permit delays, installation rework

**10. Washroom Accessibility Compliance (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Universal washroom (106) detailed with specific clearances
- Dimensional requirements shown:
  - 1'-6 1/4" (460mm min / 480mm max) for fixture clearances
  - 2'-6" (760mm min) for transfer space
  - Turning radius requirements
  - Grab bar locations and heights
- Coordination with:
  - Plumbing rough-in locations
  - Wall blocking for accessories
  - Door swing clearances
- **Risk**: Accessibility code non-compliance, costly rework

**11. Steel Stud Gauge Requirements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Specific gauge requirements based on wall height:
  - Walls ≤ 12'-0" AFF: 25 gauge minimum steel studs
  - Walls 12'-0" to 17'-0" AFF: 20 gauge minimum steel studs
  - Walls ≥ 17'-0" AFF: 18 gauge minimum steel studs
  - P.Eng sealed shop drawings required
- **Coordination needed**:
  - Architectural wall heights
  - Structural loading
  - Shop drawing submission and approval
- **Risk**: Structural inadequacy, code issues
