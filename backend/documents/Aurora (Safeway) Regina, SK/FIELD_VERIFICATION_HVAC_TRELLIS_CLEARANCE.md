# FIELD VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS
## HVAC Ductwork vs. Trellis Clearance Coordination
**Aurora Food Store - 2000 Anaquod Road, Regina, SK**
**Project #2445 | Date Issued: 2026-01-09**

---

## CRITICAL COORDINATION ISSUE

**Potential conflict:** Main HVAC supply/return ductwork may interfere with suspended trellis structures in sales floor area.

**Estimated clearance:** 13"-26" (TIGHT - requires field verification)

---

## REQUIRED INFORMATION TO VERIFY CLEARANCE

### 1. FINISHED FLOOR ELEVATION (CRITICAL - CURRENTLY UNKNOWN)
**Who:** General Contractor Site Superintendent
**Where to find:**
- Architectural floor plans (typically noted as datum 100'-0" or similar)
- Foundation/concrete drawings
- Site survey benchmarks

**Field verification:**
- [ ] Confirm finished floor elevation: _____________ (elev.)
- [ ] Verify at multiple locations (floor may not be level)
- [ ] Note any grade changes/ramps in sales floor area

---

### 2. UNDERSIDE OF DECK ELEVATION (VERIFY AS-BUILT)
**Who:** Structural/General Contractor
**Drawing reference:** Structural sections show U/S DECK = 121'-6" to 122'-3" (varies)

**Field measurements needed:**
- [ ] Measure deck elevation at grid intersections where trellis is located
- [ ] Specific locations to check:
  - Grid _____ (produce area)
  - Grid _____ (meat/seafood area)
  - Grid _____ (any area with trellis per F1.1/F4.1)
- [ ] Document actual U/S deck heights: _____________

**Critical question:** Are there joist drops or beam pockets that reduce clear height below nominal deck elevation?

---

### 3. MECHANICAL DUCTWORK ROUTING & SIZING
**Who:** Mechanical Contractor
**Drawing reference:** Mechanical plans M3.1, M4.1 (if available in full set)

**Information required:**
- [ ] Main supply trunk duct sizes serving each RTU:
  - RTU-1 (largest - 40 ton): ______ x ______
  - RTU-2 (25 ton): ______ x ______
  - RTU-3 (12.5 ton): ______ x ______
  - RTU-4/5/6 (3 ton each): ______ x ______

- [ ] Return duct sizes: ______ x ______

- [ ] Duct insulation thickness: ______" (typically 1"-2")

- [ ] Bottom of duct elevation (AFF) at these locations:
  - Above produce area: _______ AFF
  - Above meat/seafood area: _______ AFF
  - Above deli/bakery: _______ AFF
  - Above pharmacy: _______ AFF

**Critical questions:**
1. Can main trunk ducts route AROUND trellis locations?
2. Are flexible transitions possible to avoid trellis?
3. What is minimum duct clearance from trellis per mechanical specs?

---

### 4. TRELLIS INSTALLATION ELEVATIONS (CONFIRM FINAL)
**Who:** Decor/Millwork Contractor (TC Paris per shop drawings)
**Drawing reference:** SAF-TRE-001-R6, SAF-TRE-003-R3, F4.1 RCP

**Verify these dimensions:**
- [ ] Bottom of trellis mounting height: **15'-4" AFF** (per F4.1) - CONFIRM
- [ ] Trellis depth/height: **~9-1/4" to 11-11/16"** (per shop dwg SAF-TRE-001)
- [ ] **Calculated top of trellis: ~16'-3" to 16'-4" AFF**

**Field verification needed:**
- [ ] Actual bottom mounting elevation after cable adjustment: _______ AFF
- [ ] Any variance from drawings: _______
- [ ] Cable length installed: _______ (affects final height)
- [ ] Number of suspension points: _______ (affects sag)

**Note:** Shop drawings indicate "LENGTH OF CABLE TBD, NUMBER OF HANGING POINTS TBD" - verify actual installation per J.H. Cohoon Engineering letter dated Sept. 28, 2023.

---

### 5. CLOUD CEILING LOCATIONS (SECONDARY CONCERN)
**Who:** Decor/GC
**Drawing reference:** F4.1, F4.2 RCP

**Verify:**
- [ ] Cloud ceiling elevations: 15'-4" AFF (same as trellis)
- [ ] Cloud ceiling locations vs. duct routing
- [ ] Any conflicts identified: _______

---

## COORDINATION MEETING REQUIRED

**Attendees must include:**
1. General Contractor Site Super
2. Mechanical Contractor Foreman/Coordinator
3. Decor Contractor (TC Paris or installer)
4. Architect/Engineer (CGM Engineering - Mechanical)
5. Sobeys Project Manager

**Before meeting, each party must provide:**
- Mechanical: Shop drawings showing duct routing, sizes, and bottom elevations (AFF)
- Decor: Final trellis suspension plan with cable lengths and hanging points
- GC: Verified deck elevations and finished floor datum

---

## CALCULATION WORKSHEET

**Use this to determine actual clearance:**

| Dimension | Source | Elevation/Height |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| A. U/S of Deck | Structural as-built | _______ (elev.) |
| B. Duct depth (including insulation) | Mechanical shop dwg | _______ (inches) |
| C. Bottom of ductwork (A - B) | Calculated | _______ (elev.) |
| D. Finished Floor | Architectural datum | _______ (elev.) |
| E. Bottom of duct AFF (C - D) | Calculated | _______ AFF |
| F. Top of trellis | Decor shop dwg | _______ AFF |
| **G. CLEARANCE (E - F)** | **CRITICAL** | **_______ inches** |

**Minimum acceptable clearance:** _______ (per mechanical/code requirements - typically 6" minimum for access)

**Status:**
- [ ] ADEQUATE - No action required
- [ ] TIGHT - Proceed with caution, monitor during installation
- [ ] CONFLICT - STOP WORK, redesign/reroute required

---

## RESOLUTION OPTIONS IF CONFLICT EXISTS

1. **Relocate/eliminate trellis sections** in conflict zones
2. **Reroute ductwork** around trellis (may require smaller branch ducts)
3. **Reduce trellis mounting height** (verify min. clearance to customers - typically 6'-8" min)
4. **Raise trellis** if adequate clearance exists above (verify lighting/sprinkler impacts)
5. **Use flat oval ductwork** to reduce vertical dimension in conflict areas
6. **Combine smaller duct runs** if possible to reduce number of drops

---

## APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR CHANGES

Any modification to trellis height or ductwork routing requires:
- [ ] Sobeys Design Manager approval
- [ ] Sobeys Project Manager approval (Jeff Craig / Shanwen Hsu)
- [ ] Architect review (Nejmark Architecture)
- [ ] Mechanical Engineer approval (CGM Engineering)
- [ ] Structural Engineer if loading changes (Lavergne Draward & Associates)
- [ ] Issue PCN or clarification documenting change
